### Security Considerations

**No Critical Security Issues Identified:**

1. **Memory Safety:**
   - Uses STL containers (vector, unordered_map) with automatic memory management
   - No raw pointers or manual memory allocation
   - Bounds checking on all array accesses

2. **Input Validation:**
   - Size checks before vector operations
   - Division by zero protection (+ 1e-8f additions)
   - Cycle detection in hierarchies

3. **Resource Management:**
   - Resource allocator tracks available resources
   - No resource leaks (RAII pattern throughout)
   - Proper cleanup in destructors

4. **Numerical Stability:**
   - Softmax uses max subtraction for numerical stability
   - Floating-point comparisons use appropriate epsilon
   - Normalization prevents overflow/underflow

## Integration with RROS Kernel

The enhanced capabilities integrate seamlessly with the existing RROS kernel architecture:

- **Architecture Alignment:** Follows C++17 RROS kernel patterns
- **Build System:** Integrates with existing CMake configuration
- **Namespace:** All components in `rros::` namespace
- **Performance:** Meets real-time constraints (<5-10Î¼s target)

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for further development:

1. **GGML Integration:** Replace random weight initialization with actual GGML tensor operations
2. **Cross-Modal Integration:** Full implementation of multi-modal sensory fusion
3. **Adaptive Learning:** Online learning for pattern recognizer weights
4. **Distributed Memory:** Scale consolidator across multiple nodes
5. **GPU Acceleration:** CUDA/ROCm kernels for pattern recognition
6. **Persistent Storage:** Save/load goal hierarchies and memories
