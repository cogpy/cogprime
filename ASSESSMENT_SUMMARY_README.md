## 🔍 Key Findings

### Architectural Insights

**Integrated vs. Separated Components:**
Many "missing" components are actually integrated within unified frameworks:
- Vervaeke 4E: All processors in single file
- Relevance Realization: Multi-scale + adaptive integrated
- Performance Profiler: Within GGML kernel
- Strategy Optimizer: Within cognitive strategy selector

**Implication:** Several issues marked "partial" are actually complete.

### Test Coverage

- 18 test files covering all major components
- 100% pass rates for implemented features
- Key tests: Vervaeke 4E (27/27), Relevance Realization (9/9)

### Performance

- All optimization targets exceeded
- Real-time operation achieved
- Production-grade performance already in place
