## How to Create the Issues on GitHub

### Recommended Method (Batch Creation)
```bash
cd issues_to_create
bash create_all_issues.sh
```

### Alternative Methods
See `CREATE_ISSUES.md` for:
- GitHub Actions workflow execution
- Python script usage
- Individual GitHub CLI commands
- Manual creation via web UI

## Verification

All 15 issues have been:
- ✅ Generated from authoritative source (`.github/scripts/generate_issues.py`)
- ✅ Saved as properly formatted markdown files
- ✅ Organized sequentially (01-15)
- ✅ Tagged with appropriate labels
- ✅ Documented with comprehensive README
- ✅ Ready for creation on GitHub

## Next Steps

To actually create these issues on GitHub:

1. **Authenticate with GitHub CLI**:
   ```bash
   gh auth login
   ```

2. **Execute the batch creation script**:
   ```bash
   cd issues_to_create
   bash create_all_issues.sh
   ```

3. **Verify creation**:
   - Check GitHub repository issues tab
   - Confirm all 15 issues exist
   - Verify labels and content

## Dependencies and Workflow

The issues are designed to be executed in order:
- Phase 2 (issues 1-5) builds on Phase 1 (already complete)
- Phase 3 (issues 6-10) requires Phase 2 completion
- Phase 4 (issues 11-15) requires Phase 3 completion

Some parallel execution is possible within each phase (see `issues_to_create/README.md` for details).

## Notes

These issue files provide a complete, ready-to-use specification for the CogPrime development roadmap. They can be created on GitHub at any time using any of the provided methods.

The files are version-controlled and can be:
- Modified before creation if needed
- Used as templates for similar issues
- Referenced for project planning and estimation
- Integrated into project management tools
