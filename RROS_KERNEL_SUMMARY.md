### Cognitive Modes Implemented

```cpp
enum class CognitiveMode {
    SELECTIVE_ATTENTION,    // Bottom-up salience detection
    WORKING_MEMORY,        // Active maintenance and manipulation  
    PROBLEM_SPACE,         // Goal-directed search and navigation
    SIDE_EFFECTS,          // Action consequence evaluation
    LONG_TERM_MEMORY,      // Organizational and retrieval systems
    META_COGNITIVE         // Higher-order monitoring and control
};
```

## 🔧 API and Usage Examples

### Basic Cognitive Processing

```cpp
#include "core/rros_kernel.hpp"

// Initialize kernel
rros::RROSKernel kernel({
    {"relevance_threshold", 0.3f},
    {"memory_capacity", 5000.0f}
});

// Process cognitive cycle
std::vector<float> input = {0.1f, 0.3f, 0.5f, 0.7f, 0.9f};
auto state = kernel.cognitive_cycle(input);

// Results: relevance, attention, confidence
std::cout << "Relevance: " << state.global_relevance << std::endl;
std::cout << "Confidence: " << state.confidence << std::endl;
```

### Episode-Specific Processing

```cpp
// Activate specific episodes for targeted processing
kernel.activate_episode(rros::Episode::PLATO_CAVE, 0.8f);
kernel.activate_episode(rros::Episode::MINDFULNESS_INSIGHT, 1.0f);

// Process through Plato's Cave episode
float cave_insight = kernel.process_episode(
    rros::Episode::PLATO_CAVE, 
    {0.3f, 0.6f, 0.2f, 0.8f, 0.5f}
);

// Cave insight: 0.421 (reality vs appearance distinction)
```

### Attention Allocation

```cpp
// Multi-target attention allocation
std::vector<std::vector<float>> targets = {
    {0.2f, 0.3f, 0.1f},  // Low salience
    {0.8f, 0.9f, 0.7f},  // High salience  
    {0.5f, 0.4f, 0.6f}   // Medium salience
};

auto weights = kernel.allocate_attention(targets);
// Results: [0.15, 0.65, 0.20] - high salience gets most attention
```
