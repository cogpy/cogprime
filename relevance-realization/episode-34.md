**The Idea of the Holy**  

"Otto and his book that, as I mentioned, was typically entitled The Idea Of The Holy"  

“The Idea of the Holy”: An Inquiry into the Non-Rational Factor in the Idea of the Divine and its Relation to the Rational is a book by the German theologian and philosopher Rudolf Otto, published in 1917. It argues that the defining element of the holy is the experience of a phenomenon which Otto calls the numinous.

# Ep. 35 - Awakening from the Meaning Crisis - The Symbol, Sacredness, and the Sacred

Welcome back to awakening from the meaning crisis. Last time we were continuing our exploration of Sacredness and I talked about that in contrast, but also in concert with, Geartz’s notion of Sacredness as homing us against horror we have the proposal from Otto that Sacredness puts us into contact with the Numinous, which basically exposes us to what is horrifying. At least at the limits of us, because it has an aspect of awe with a little bit more which is to remind us - humiliation in the original sense of the word - to keep us, to give us humility to remember that as we are feeling that sense of expansiveness with awe that we are precisely, ultimately, limited creatures. And so I propose to you that these two opponent aspects of sacredness can be seen very readily within the light of the machinery of relevance realization, where the Worldview Attunement is a form of meta-meaning and therefore meta-assimilation; ultimately compression, integration, things fitting together. We get an opposite, which is the meta-accommodation afforded by confronting the numinous in awe and potentially horror; and we talked about how horror is about exactly the demand, the confrontation with that which demands from us unanswerable, unachievable accommodation.

So I propose to you that what sacredness is, is to seriously play with the machinery of relevance realization as found within the primordial aspects of Religio, and that doing this would be deeply advantageous to us because it is so foundational to our agency, to the world as an arena for our action, to our capacities for self-transcendence, and so forth. But caught up with that, when I invoked music as an example of this, was the idea that we often do this serious play by engaging in symbolic behavior. And so I'm putting ‘Symbol’ here as something that has the capacity to function both ways: it can bring us into meta-accommodation, but of course it can also bring meta-assimilation.

It can bridge between these two and it can go in both directions. And so we were starting to unpack what the symbol is \(draws a big downward arrow from Symbol\). And then I propose to you to, first of all, \[I\] emphasized its distinction from a mere sign: a Symbol doesn't just refer, a Symbol exemplifies, it has a participatory aspect to it right from the beginning. And as I've already mentioned that's going to be central to what we're talking about here, because these \(both “meta’s”\) are at the level of our, ultimately, our participation in the Agent-Arena transactive evolution of our relevance realization processes.

So I suggested to you that at the core of a symbol is a metaphor \(adds this to the arrow down from Symbol\). Already we know that this \(Symbol\) has to be participatory \(adds this to another arrow coming down and to the left of Symbol, below meta-assimilation\); we'll come back to that. And I pointed out that the metaphors we're talking about here are profound in the sense that they are pervasive in our cognition, and they are highly functional \(adds “profound - pervasive - highly functional” to an arrow down from Metaphor\) and pointed here to the work of Lakoff and Johnson, and their work in metaphors we live by, and a whole bunch of other books about how much our cognition is metaphorical. I then said there's some issues here - and this goes to some critiques made by Vervaeke and Kennedy, and Kennedy and Vervaeke - basically saying that they have this purely bottom-up notion that the physical, sensory motor domain is just projected up into the conceptual. I suggested that it's more complex than that, and we took a look at that, and I suggested to you that instead of just the machinery of projection, which tends to be this one way, that we should think of the participatory relation as reflecting our capacity to play with exaptation \(adds exaptation to participatory on the board\); we can go both ways with our exaptive machinery.

Then I tried to bring all these ideas together: the notion of participatory knowing, the notion of exaptation \(brings two arrows down from both to a single point\), with this idea that what a Symbol is, it's a metaphor that allows me to hold something in mind that I normally can't hold in mind. So that I can activate the machinery - the machinery that was at work in exaptation - and I can, in a sense, reverse, go back through it. I can have a symbol of a scale, and I could just stay there and think that, or what I can do is, I can actually try to participate, perspectivally; I can engage with actually ‘balancing.’ And then what I can do is reverse that process, to some degree, by which my capacity for balance has been exapted via some exaptive processing on my cerebellum, so that I actually use it to find complex contingency relationships between any areas of my brain.

So what's been happening, in fact, in neuroscience over the last 10 - 15 years is this revolution of our understanding of the cerebellum. We used to think the cerebellum was primarily about balance. And now we know that the cerebellum has all these terrific cognitive functions, because what it does is it basically… here’s \(gesticulating\) two areas of the brain that are often correlated together. The cerebellum picks up on trying to improve, smooth out, find the patterns of contingency and dependency between them. And so what I can do is, I can activate - if you'll allow me this way of talking - my cerebellum and that machinery which is precisely the machinery I need to practice the skill of being more ‘just’; I need the ability to coordinate, to find, to sense complex contingencies between multiple variables and make that better. The cerebellum is exactly the machinery I want to activate - I'm using activation as like the reverse of exaptation - I want to activate it because that will actually allow me to participate in the processing, that will allow me to cultivate the skills that will make me ‘just’, that will then ultimately ground my conception of ‘justice.’

So this holding in mind \(adds “holding - activation” to the double arrow\), activating process allows me to deeply participate in justice, because I'm literally becoming more just\! The symbol is affording me, by making use of the exaptation machinery, which is - do you see that this \(participatory side\) is bi-directional in a way in which the projection \(bottom-up side\) isn't - The Symbol is doing that for me in a powerful way. And you're saying, “Wow, this is so… Ahhhhggg, really? Come on.” Okay… You are much more symbolic, in a participatory fashion, than you might think. Okay, look at these quickly:  

Without thinking, which one is “Buba” and which one is “Kiki”?  

Overwhelmingly - and I mean \[overwhelmingly\] because this experiment has been done by Ramachandran \(The Emerging Mind & The Tell Tale Brain\) and others - this is Buba and this is Kiki \(indicates which is which on the board - you intuitively know which is which\!\). I do this all the time in my class\! What's going on there? Why is this Buba and this Kiki? You've never heard these words before\! They don't mean anything to you\! And people will say things like, “Well, this is sharp and spiky \(the ‘star’\). And so is this \(the word Kiki\).” And I say to them, “what do you mean? How is this sharp? I can't cut myself on it. And how is this sharp and spiky \(the word\)?” And they're doing all this bridging and this cerebellar coordination between different sense modalities and different ways of acting, and you're doing it like that \(dramatically claps hands\)\! There it is\! Now, this is playful. I'm just activating it to no purpose, but of course I can activate this machinery to a purpose. That's what I'm doing when I'm holding up the scales\! But you have to participate in it, you have to live with the symbol. You have to internalise it. It's almost like you have to savour it. One of the things we need to pay more attention to, I would argue, is the work of Jonathan Pageau. I mean, his work on the symbolic world is largely about trying to get us to remember the symbolic aspects of our existence. And I mean this in a deeply respectful way, and I hope Jonathan takes it that way: to get us to savour the symbolic and how deeply functional and active it is in us.

So symbols are participatory in this fashion that I've tried to explain to you, and then because of that, symbols have a capacity to put us into this relationship with something. So here's justice, here's the symbol, here's me \(writes: “Me Symbol justice” \(Fig. 3\)\), and as I've tried to argue, we've got the symbol, and what it's doing is it's actually transforming me in a powerful way \(see Fig. 3, arrow 1\). It is reactivating, reconfiguring my machinery so that I become capable of interacting with the world, so that I now start to be able to see through this symbol \(Fig. 3, arrow 2\) - here's the original m\[etaphor\]; remember how you’re looking through the pig at Sam? - I'm looking through, which means beyond and by means of, the symbol \(gestures along arrow 2\). I get to see more and realize and make more justice. So, I'm becoming \(gestures along arrow 1\), I'm activating the machinery of balance that's allowing me that perspectival awareness that’s sensitizing me to the contingent relationships between variables; it's actually helping me to cultivate the skills of justice. And of course, as I start to get better contact with \[justice\], \[it\] is disclosing itself in a new way \(fig 1, arrow 3\) and it discloses itself more through the processing I'm doing.

Fig. 3

## Meditation As An Example Of Breath As A Symbol

And so what starts to happen is this interesting thing that's going on. So let me try and give you another example of this, and let's use something at the other end, something that's not so conceptual, at least in one sense. So I'm meditating and I'm following my breath in meditation, breathing in and out following my breath. Some of you have seen, perhaps, the videos I've given on the instruction on how to practice Vipassana. Now what's happening is, normally I am focusing on my breath, and that act of focusing and following my breath is helping me to scale down, and we've talked about that; \[to\] scale down my attention. And for a long time, it can stay that way. But what can happen is, I can become sensitized by scaling down - because you increase your sensitivity - to how much in process my mind is. So I'm normally thinking of my mind as a thing. I might even think that my mind is a container that contains things. Like, here's my mind \(gesticulating\) and in it is an experience of pain, for example. 

But when I practice watching my breath, I start to realize that that's not actually how my mind is unfolding.

My mind really isn't like a container in that sense. It's much more like my mind is a very fine-grained process\! And even something like pain isn't a thing; there's ‘paining’. And it's multiple. When I'm watching my pain, for example I've got a pain in my leg while I'm meditating, there's all these different layers. There's all these things unfolding and happening in a complex fashion. It really isn't a noun; it’s much more like a verb. And it's really not something I possess. It's really much more something I participate in. So, do you see what I'm saying? The breath starts to become a participatory symbol of the impermanence of things, how much they are interconnected and flowing. And that can then have an impact on my sense of myself… that maybe *I* am much more impermanent and interconnected. And so the breath can become, in that sense, symbolic for me. I can start to see… look through the breath \(Fig. 3, arrow 2\) into impermanence and interconnectedness, and I start to look back \(Fig. 3, arrow 3\). And so what's happening - you can also train this deliberately – is, in addition to scaling down, I might suddenly find myself scaling up, and seeing how all of reality, including myself, is impermanent and interconnected.

## Flags And Patriotism As Another Example

So notice what the symbol is doing for you here. And here I want to go back to Michael Polanyi again. Let's take another symbol. Here's a Patriot looking at the American Flag. So Polanyi says: when you're looking at a flag - of course, you're always doing that thing he talked about: all their subsidiary awareness \(SA\) is being integrated together into your focal awareness \(FA\) \(draws many instances of SA converging together onto the flag \(FA\)\). Now, normally, I'm doing all of this \[convergence/SA\] because what I'm interested in is what I'm focally aware of \(FA\); I'm interested in the flag \(circles the flag\). So normally, when I want to drink, I'm doing all of this subsidiary integration into my focal awareness of the bottle, because what I'm actually interested in is the bottle. I need to get the bottle to drink. But sometimes - and again, notice my language - we play with this. We look at the flag - not because we're actually intrinsically interested in using the flag in some fashion - we’re using the flag symbolically. I'm looking at the flag, because by looking at the flag I’m actually integrating \(Fig. 4a, a\) different aspects of myself together. So although I'm doing this process \(indicates the convergence flow\), normally what I'm inherently interested in is the focal object \(flag\). But sometimes, when I'm acting symbolically - although I'm focusing my attention on \[the flag\], like focusing my attention on the breath - what I'm actually interested in is playing with the process \(the convergence SA arrows - see Fig 4a - a\).

Fig. 4a

Fig. 4b

So by contemplating the flag, the Patriot is bringing up all kinds of emotions and associations and other things - and think about the cerebellar activity here - and integrating them together. By looking through all of these - and think about the metaphor; “by looking through” - by looking through all of these things, like \(demonstrates on the board through Fig. 4a, a\) I'm looking through all of these different subsidiary things onto the flag, and by doing that I'm actually integrating all of these aspects of myself together, and I'm becoming more patriotic. I'm actually participating in patriotism.

## Focusing On The Breath

That's powerful. Now, put that together with what I just did: I'm looking at my breath \(changes the flag in the diagram to “breath” \(See Fig. 4b\), and I'm doing all this, and the point about all of this is to integrate all of my processing together. And that's one way in which my breath is symbolic. So one way in which my breath is symbolic is, it gives me a focal thing that I'm aware of, I can activate all of this stuff, and I can integrate myself onto the thing; I’m becoming somebody else. But, as I just said a few minutes ago, the thing is, the breath can also suddenly disclose reality to me \(Fig 4b, b\). The breath can also reveal an aspect of reality. Okay, let's try and put this together very carefully here. \(Wipes board clean.\)

At one stage, I'm doing this \(Fig 5a - draws converging arrows as in Fig. 4a&b\) and what I'm interested in is this, this is my Inherent Interest \(labels these arrows “I.I.”\). Although my Focal Awareness is here \(circle - FA\), I'm focusing precisely because I'm trying to, via a metaphorical process by looking through all of these subsidiary elements, I'm actually integrating them together. I'm not actually trying to get an insight like I normally do in metaphor, but what can happen is \[that\] I can actually get an insight\! This \(Fig5b, circle\) can suddenly reveal aspects of the world to me \(Fig 5b arrows\), the impermanence and interconnectedness. And now I'm actually interested in my breath, because my breath is a symbol in another sense. My breath is a symbol in that it allows me to see into the impermanence and interconnectedness of reality. Notice what could happen is I can resonate between these \(Fig 5, arrow r\).

Fig. 5

Okay, let's do it: I'm looking at my breath. I become more integrated and precisely because I'm much more integrated, my processing becomes more powerful. And then suddenly what happens is, I see something in my breath. I get a realization. The world is disclosed to me, and that opens me up in powerful ways. And then now, when I refocus on the breath again, now I'm reintegrating all of that. But then what can happen is \[that\] now, as I reintegrate and re-coordinate again, I can more deeply see into what the reality of my breath is disclosing to me, and I move more deeply. Do you see what I'm saying? You get this symbolic resonance that's going on. As I see more deeply into the object, it draws me in, and then that affords much more powerful integration. But the much more powerful integration actually coordinates my cognition much more so \[that\] I can see more deeply into the reality, if I'm relating to it symbolically.

Symbols are, in this sense, capable of affording Anagoge. They are capable of giving you this capacity whereby I get inner-optimization, and then I see more deeply into the thing. And then by seeing more deeply into the thing, I get more inner optimization, and the whole process flows Anagogically. 

So I'm looking at the balance, and then I activate all of this machinery, and then I look through it at the symbol, and I'm looking through it at justice and coordinating all the things. But then I start to see aspects in the balance that I hadn't seen before, precisely because of how sensitized I am to the symbol. I start to see how it's actually never completely stable; if you look at the pictures of the scales, they are often always off\! Balance is very much a process, not a thing. And then that causes me to activate different aspects of myself. This is like, if you remember, when the mother-in-law has the bi-directional insight; the Sensibility Transcendence. Not only seeing her daughter-in-law differently, but seeing her own seeing differently; that transframing.

So symbols have the capacity to do this. Let's return back to something that I think is purely symbolic, in the sense that I mean, which is music. So you're listening to the music, but it's not like when you're listening to a sound and you're trying to make out like, “What's that? What's causing that sound? Is it a tiger? Is it a noise in the bush?” You're listening the music and although you're focusing on it, you're not trying to get behind it. You're focusing on it because the way in which you're being integrated in, together by, onto the music, is crucial. But then what happens of course, is that aspects of the music are disclosed to you and you realize things, you see things that you haven't seen before, and that changes and alters how you can then understand and listen to the music. And so you get drawn in, in a very powerful way.

## Symbols And The Mysterious

Now let's put \[-\] all of this machinery together with another aspect of the symbol that I've already hinted at which is, of course, the way in which symbols are putting you into confrontation with what is potentially mysterious. So here's your frame \(draws box - Fig 6, box 1\), and here is a frame you aspire to, a more comprehensive one \(draws larger, dotted box - Fig 6, box 3\), and you need something that can reach you inside this frame \(Fig 6, arrow 1\), but it can't be totally captured by this frame \(box 1\), because if it's captured by this frame, you'll stay in this frame. It has to insinuate itself into this, but change stuff such that it actually drives you to expanding your frame \(Fig 6, arrow & box 2\). So it has to both activate you, but draw you beyond yourself to a state…

Fig. 6

What a symbol has to do is, it has to reach into your world view, but remember what the Gnostics we're talking about here. Remember how you're existentially entrapped. You want to be in another worldview, you want to find that world view viable. You need something that can come into this worldview, but won't be stable within it; it has to be transgressive, it has to shake things up, and then put you into all of this machinery - all of this machinery that we've been talking about - but in a way that is making you move to, and become capable of dwelling within, that more expansive worldview. In this sense, symbols are deeply ecstatic \(writes ek-stasis on the board\) - we got our word ecstasy from this - but what this literally means is, a symbol helps you to stand beyond yourself.

So let's go back to the example… I'm trying to use as many examples as possible. I've got the scales, I'm activating balance, that allows me to start doing the skills that gets me some sense of justice. I start to be able to see justice, and realize justice in the world, that I couldn't before because of my sensibility change, my skill acquisition, my sensibility transcendence. And that starts to make me more just. And then what's happening is, my world is being opened up and, in a coordinated fashion, I'm being transformed to fit that expanding world. This is of course why symbols often are associated with wonder and awe, et cetera. So symbols are ecstatic in that fashion. As I've tried to show you throughout this, they're Participatory \(writes this on the board below ek-stasis\). And I’ve tried to show you how they're Integrative, not just in a simple part: whole, but in the Anagogic sense - Sensibility Transcendence \(writes Integrative - anagogic below Participatory\). They're integrating you together, they're integrating a new world together, and they're integrating that new world together as they're integrating you together in an integrated fashion.

So when a Christian sees the cross, first of all the cross is tapping into that exaptive machinery; it's taking all this perceptual machinery and it's playing with it - the vertical and the horizontal. That's being exapted, and all of that machinery that we normally look through is being exapted and is being used, and then we're looking into there… and if we are receptive - and of course the question is why some people are and why some people aren’t. - but if we're receptive, then that interaction starts to affect us. We start to become a different kind of person as we're integrated in our attention on the cross.  

But that, of course, starts to also disclose to us aspects of reality that we normally might not be able to hold in mind; like suffering, like the relationship between eternity and time. And those goes from being ideas to things that we are confronting, engaging with, and they can draw us in, which then of course integrates me more powerfully, while disclosing a world. And if I'm willing to play the serious play with the symbol, I will start to be transformed in a coupled fashion to my world, such that, perhaps, Christianity becomes viable for me, for example. This is how symbols work. So they're integrative in the Anagogic sense. This is of course, if you remember, why people do things like Jeepform.

Finally, symbols are Complex \(writes Complex below Integrative\). And we have to remember: I'm using the scales to stand for justice, but justice isn't a single thing. And even when I talk about the breath and it's showing me impermanence and interconnectedness, those aren't single static things. They are complex unfolding realities. So symbols often are multifaceted. You'll get Athena, she's the symbol of wisdom, but she's also the symbol of weaving. She's the symbol of warfare. All these different areas are actually being drawn together, because the symbol is also the potential for radically reconfiguring the shape of your salience landscape, connecting things that you normally do not connect together, such that you might have an insight into reality.

Notice how the symbol is trying to do all of this. Because it’s trying to set you in motion. It's trying to get you to do this. \(Draws out fig. 7 from the small box to the large, then the arrow - See Fig 7a\). And in that sense, if you'll forgive the little bit of playfulness, it's ‘Epic’; it's trying to draw you into something E.P.I.C. \(circles the acronym for Ek-Stasis, Participatory, Integrative & Complex. See Fig 7b\). 

It's trying to afford a way in which you can radically open up your world in meta-accomodation - triggering it, participating in it, confronting it - but also trigger your best machinery for being able to draw it into, relate it to who and what you are, so that you can become capable of dwelling within that expanded world. So meta-accommodation and meta-assimilation are both at work within the symbol.

Fig. 7a                                                        Fig.7b

## How Symbols Relate To Sacredness

So, symbols are inherently transjective \(indicates the dynamic in Fig.6\) because they are between two worlds: the world you’re in/the framing you're in and the world you're trying to move to/the world that you aspire to. They are transgressive in all the ways I've tried to suggest to you. They try to trigger transframing. They're transformative. 

Now, how does all of that machinery relate to sacredness? Well, I've already shown you how it can be bound up with awe and horror and wonder, but let's try \[to\] make this a little bit more precise. I'm going to propose something to you. I'm going to propose that we can use this term, “Mythos” differently - as I have been throughout the series \(writes Mythos on the board\). I’m going to use Mythos rather than Myth, to keep that distinction\! By Mythos, I mean something that's always deeply connected to ritual, where ritual - and I've already argued this - doesn't mean some neurotic routine that I engage in. Ritual means enactive analogy, enactive Anagoge \(writes ritual below mythos\). It means the processes by which I try to activate the machinery of transformation. So when I'm saying ‘mythos’, don't just hear ‘patterns of representation,’ hear ‘patterns of interaction’; these are deeply enmeshed together. And then what we have are symbols - in the way that I'm describing - and these symbols are always going to be enmeshed with story, because you have to bring in the Perspectival Participatory knowing - and we've talked a bunch about how important narrative is for participatory and perspectival knowing. And of course the story connects to the ritual, because if its ‘storied’, you can enact it \(writes symbols to the right of mythos and story completing the square on the bottom right, with mythos also connecting to story - see Fig. 8a\). Okay. So this is what I mean by mythos. \(indicating the whole of Fig 8a\). 

When we have a mythos that is about Religio, such that we can activate Religio and seriously play with it in order to enhance it - enhance its capacities for meta-assimilation and meta-accomodation… That's Sacredness \(Fig 8b\). 

Fig. 8a                                   Fig. 8b

Of course we can invoke, we can make use of Mythos for other things, for other patterns that we care about. Of course our Religio is always at work just in our day to day interactions with the world. But when we want to activate, accentuate, articulate Religio itself, we rely on Mythos to do that, because our relationship to Religio is one that can only be born symbolically, because of the primordial, participatory nature of Religio.

Now here's something else: Of course, at the core of Religio, as I've argued, is Relevance Realization, and one of the things we know, because of the phenomenon of insight and the phenomenon of flow, is one of the things that relevance realization is intrinsically interested in, is itself. Relevance Realization, because it is a self-organizing, self-transcending, self-correcting process - remember, in insight you are correcting for a misleading salience pattern, given an incorrect problem formulation - Relevance Realization is intrinsically set up to be interested in itself. This is part of its structural design. If your Relevance Realization machinery is not directed to be interested in itself, it's ultimately not a self-organizing, self-correcting, self-developing process, which would mean it would cease to be relevance realization. It is constitutively necessary of relevance realization that it finds itself inherently interesting \(see Fig 9\).

Fig. 9

So we can find the process… So this \(draws a box around Religio in Fig 9\) is just deeply valuable to us because it's constitutive of our being in the world. We can use Mythos \(boxes mythos\) to activate, articulate, accentuate, celebrate Religio. And of course, we find that a deeply interesting thing to do \(Fig. 9 arrow i\) because relevance realization is set up, by it's evolutionary heritage, to be intrinsically interested in itself. And so we are going to find all of this deeply valuable, deeply meaningful. This is the machinery of meaning making \(indicates Religio in Fig 9\), and then we're using mythos to celebrate it and trigger the fact that relevance realization is constituted to finding itself interesting.

So what we have is, I think, a way of talking about a lot of the aspects of Sacredness. We get the experience of Sacredness out of the deep machinery of Religio, and when we're using the centrally important machinery of Mythos to activate it, accentuate it, articulate it, celebrate it; and that in itself is developmentally important to us, but serious play is the way in which we go through development. But we also find that process intrinsically interesting - like an insight, or the flow state - precisely because relevance realization is constituted to reflectively be interested in itself as a process. 

Now, the question is: “Yes, okay, maybe all of that is right. Maybe what I'm doing in sacredness is using Mythos in order to celebrate and appreciate and accentuate Religio, and I'm going to find that valuable because Religio is inherently valuable to me, and relevance realization is inherently interested in itself…. I get all of that. And I get why this can be so deeply transformative of people and why it can open up their world, and open up themselves in this way that feels like making love with reality. But still, you're not getting the essence of Sacredness. Because the essence of Sacredness is in The Sacred \(writes The Sacred on a cleaned board\). And The Sacred takes us back to the metaphysical proposal.

## The Metaphysical Proposal & Distinguishing Product From Process

The metaphysical proposal is the proposal that what ultimately generates the experience of Sacredness is something that has an absolute value, because it has a particular metaphysical status, namely it is Supernatural \(Fig. 10\) - it is above nature - and it's ‘above-ness’ means that it is always inherently valuable to us. And therefore we will find it sacred, because of its absolute value. Now this carries with it a particular way of understanding the process of meaning making. It's to claim that, ultimately - I think that's what people are claiming - that there are things - maybe that's the wrong word, I don't \[know\], language is failing me… I'll use this word as neutrally as I can - there are ‘things’ that are always of relevance to us. What I'm suggesting to you is that this is the claim that there is an essence to relevance \(writes this to the right of the list\). That there is a final formula for being relevant, and that that essence inheres in some particular thing/object \(Fig. 10 arrow i\). And so if I come into a relationship with that object, the relevance, the essence of relevance is inhering in it and I will therefore find that object sacred.

Fig. 10

I'm trying to be respectful here, but I think this is ultimately a mistake. The reason why I think it's a mistake is because there is no essence to relevance. There isn't even a thing, there is only the ongoing process of relevance realization. There is nothing other than itself that is intrinsically interesting to relevance realization. And the relevance realization isn't even absolutely interesting to relevance realization because, of course, your salience machinery can actually lead you to kill yourself\! You may even find your own existence is no longer relevant or salient to you. So again, to say it's intrinsic, even that is not to say that it's absolute. The notion of sacredness here seems, to me, to be a category mistake. It seems to me to be saying that there is some-thing, some-one, some-place that essentially, absolutely, always, is relevant\! But that is to misunderstand the nature of relevance. It's to confuse the products of relevance realization with the process of relevance realization. And that, of course, is a hallmark of one of the ways in which we make mistakes. We get fixated on the products of our cognition and not paying attention to the process.

Let's go back to the Gnostics. Remember that one of the things that their contemporary apostolic Christians criticised them for, is that they were constantly inventing new myths, in this sense of Mythos, because they saw the relationship to sacredness as an evolving one, a deeply transgressive one, a one that was supposed to always be launching you into a trajectory of trans-framing. Might that suggest another way of understanding sacredness? \[One\] that, I think, would be respectful to a lot of the texts considered sacred, without committing us to, or needing the supernatural as a category. Or maybe it means a significant transformation of what we've ever meant by this term “supernatural”, I don't know.

There's an inexhaustibleness in this whole process. There's a sense in which Reality can continue to disclose itself to me; it's inexhaustible. And that's ultimately, I think, because of the reality that Reality is itself combinatorally explosive. There's an inexhaustibleness to the process of relevance realization, not in the sense that I'm infinite - that's ridiculous - but in the sense that the process is constantly evolving; it is constituted by its evolution, it is not something other than its evolution. What if sacredness is not about finding the completion, the essence, the stabilised final form? What if sacredness is actually an experience of the inexhaustibleness of reality, and the inexhaustibleness of the relevance realization machinery and its coupled response to that reality? What does that look like more concretely?

Let me give you an example of where you could see these two concretely distinguishing from each other. For me, Plato is Sacred. That doesn't mean that I think Plato has some absolute or supernatural value; that he has an unquestionable authority. Or that my understanding of Plato should be stabilised or finished or complete. Instead, what happens is exactly the opposite: I read some Plato and I understand some Plato - I get some insight - and that has an impact on me. And that does all of this \(gestures to the board\) to me, and then I go out in the world, and that understanding - in a perspectival and participatory way - transforms me, and I engage and I become, and the world discloses in a certain way. And after that process I return to Plato, and then I can see in Plato what I did not see before. I can realize things I did not see before, and those realizations reach deeply into me again. And then again, there's that engagement, there's that transformation, and then I go out in the world… You see how I'm doing the Anagogic thing. I go out in the world and the world is disclosed to me in ways I hadn't seen before, and then I go through transformation: I become something different, the world becomes different at the level of co-identification. Agent and Arena are being opened up. And then I go back and when I read Plato I see something again that I didn't see before… And that has happened to me throughout my life\! There isn't some final form there\! I'm meaning this very carefully: this is a “Gnostic” - not in the sense of the two world mythology or something like that - there's Gnosis here: I am constantly finding Plato to be an inexhaustible fount of insight, transformation, an inexhaustible source of trans-framing of my world and who I am. If it's ongoing, it's filled with a kind of developmental wonder for me. I don't think Plato is supernatural. I don't think Plato is absolute. I don't think Plato has the final account. I don't think Plato can give me a final definition of what is relevant. But nevertheless, again and again and again, I get into symbolic resonance with the text; I see through it, and then the world reaches back through it to me.

I mean, even Nietzsche has this. “If you stare long enough into the abyss, it begins to stare back through you.” He has a kind of sacredness around that. But it's, of course, open-ended, it's deeply symbolic - read “Also sprach Zarathustra”. But as I said, I think it's bound up with a problematic grammar of simply inverting Christianity. I don't want to invert Christianity. That's not what I'm proposing to you at all. I'm trying to suggest to you that the idea I propose to you about what Sacredness is, can be connected to an alternative proposal of what The Sacred is. The sacred is the Transjective relationship between the combinatorially explosive nature of Reality - that reality is ultimately a no-thing-ness, that ultimately it is not a thing that you can frame. Reality will always transcend your framing. That's what ‘combinatorial explosion’ says. And this is linked to the no-thing-ness of yourself\! The ‘I’ that can never be captured, the framing that can never be captured in the frame, the ongoing, never ending - not in you, particularly, but as a process… it doesn't come to a completion, is what I meant by ‘never ending’ - process of Relevance Realization. There's a deep, non-logical identity, a deep symbolic resonance between these two \(Fig 11. Arrow i\). I think it's what a lot of the mystics were talking about. This is a deep, participatory identification: the inexhaustibleness of Reality, and the inexhaustibleness of Relevance Realization are deeply, deeply coupled at the primordial levels of Religio. This is The Sacred as this \(gestures to the board - See Fig 11\), the inexhaustible that powers the experience of Sacredness in a deeply, profoundly, participatory fashion.

# **Ep. 36 – Awakening from the Meaning Crisis – Religio/Perennial Problems/Reverse Engineering Enlightenment**

Welcome back to awakening from the meaning crisis. So last time we were continuing our examination of sacredness, the experience of sacredness, the Schleiermacher side of things, and I was trying to develop an account of what symbols are – at least symbols insofar as they are distinct from signs – as a way of trying to understand the role that symbols have in our understanding of sacredness. So I was presenting to you the view that symbols are a participatory act. And that that participation has a connection to the activation of a profound kind of metaphor. By activating that metaphor, we are reaching backwards through our exaptation and reactivating that material, so that we can re-exapt our cognitive processes, and re-experience, re-appreciate, re-see, re-understand some aspect of reality. And that re-exaptation makes the use of a symbol a deeply participatory, transformative thing that we do. With a symbol, we are activating all that exaptive machinery, in order to hold something in mind so that we can see more deeply into it, be more in contact with it. And then I argued \[that\] the point of that is ultimately to set up an anagogic process by which I am transformed, so I can see through the symbol into reality, and so that reality can speak through the symbol to me, and that we get an anagogic flow happening, and I’m becoming deeply integrated, the world is becoming disclosed, and that *mutual, reciprocal realization* feels deeply like love coupling to reality in a profound way.

And so \[I argued\] that symbols are in that sense designed to get me into a trajectory of trans-framing; they’re designed to, in wonder, open up the world, and also grow me, so that I can be in that larger world. And that points to how symbols are ecstatic; they’re participatory, they’re integrative. They’re complex because they help to complexify me and disclose the complexity of the world in a coordinated fashion. And then I suggested to you that we understand symbols as Mythos; that it’s always a symbol and a story together, and that the story points to the ritual, and the ritual is also… because the Mythos is always enacted, if it’s going to bring about the transformations that it wants to bring about, or that we want to use it to bring about. I think both of those are right.

We can use Mythos to activate, accelerate, articulate, and appreciate Religio. Religio is inherently valuable to us; so even that alone is going to be very valuable to us. But in addition, the act of seriously playing, not only is it developmental of what we find intrinsically valuable, because it’s constitutive of our ability to value anything else or interact with anything we consider valuable – because it’s primordial – not only is that the case, but Relevance Realization – which is at the heart of Religio, and I’m giving you an argument for that – is constituted to it, it functions, it is structured to function, it functions by being interested in itself, correcting itself, transcending itself, developing itself. So that’s why we love the flow state. Not only is it optimal in this ‘playing with Religio,’ like the flow state it’s not only optimal in that it’s getting us to be our best, \[but\] we also find it to be an optimal experience, because we’re seriously playing with this intrinsically valuable machinery in a way that is constituently, intrinsically significant to us. And I propose that when we are using the symbol to get us to play with the machinery, the Meta-assimilation, the Meta-accommodation of sacredness – or at least the Meta-assimilation, the Meta-accommodation of the higher order Relevance Realization within sacredness – then that’s what we deeply mean by the experience of Sacredness.

## The New Proposal: Relevance Does Not Have An Essence

And then I propose to you a proposal I need to return to now. Because I only initiated it last time. I proposed to you that we move off of sacredness and onto the sacred, in a particular proposal as to what is the cause or the source of sacred-ness, “The Sacred”. And again, I’m using that term because it’s as neutral as I can find. And the proposal, which, again, you don’t find in some accounts of sacredness: The Sacred that is the Tao, I do not think is supernatural or absolute. The sacredness of Shunyata is definitely not. Right? So when Prince Wu asked Bodhidharma what was Holy about his doctrine, and he keeps pressing Bodhidharma. and he keeps saying, “No, no, not that\!” and then the Prince gets upset and says, “well, what is Holy about your doctrine?”, Bodhidharma says, “Nothing holy\! Vast emptiness\!”. Shunyata is, in that sense, sacred. But it is not Holy. At least not in the sense of a supernatural source of righteousness.

So I proposed an alternative to that idea, born from a critique. The critique was \[that\] there is something wrong about trying to essentialize ‘Sacredness’ in The Sacred. To say that the source of sacredness is something that is essentially relevant to us, absolutely, unquestionably, undeniably relevant to us, and that it is the origin and the culmination of relevance. And then I proposed to you that that just struck me, ultimately – and I do mean this with as much respect as, I mean, this is, hopefully regarded as a respectful criticism, but nevertheless, it’s a criticism – I regard that as a category mistake. Relevance Realization is not about detecting, finding something that’s inherently relevant, in the sense that it absolutely commands our attention. Relevance does not have an essence. It doesn’t work that way. Relevance Realization is, intrinsically, an evolving process. It functions by evolving and it evolves in its functioning. Does that mean we should just dispense? No, because I propose to you a couple \[of things\]. Well, I propose one thing and then I want to add another thing to it. I proposed to you that there’s a different way of thinking about sacredness that comports well with this idea of sacredness; there’s an idea, a way of thinking about the source of sacredness, that comports well with the picture of sacredness that I’ve tried to argue for. which is, namely, the idea of sacredness as the inexhaustible. The inexhaustible aspects of this reality \(knocks the wall and the desk\).

It’s kind of like turning Kant on its head. This reality is always a source of wonder for me, not because there is an object that specifically or absolutely has the claim on me of being the source of wonder\! Every object, every thing is combinatorially explosive: vast emptiness\! Ultimately, there is a ‘no-thingness’ to reality because everything is combinatorially explosive in terms of what it is. But my processing, precisely because of the way it operates, has an inexhaustibleness to it too – a no-thingness to it\! The “I” that is never reducible\! There is always the framing that can never be captured in the frame, because the process of Relevance Realization is ongoing, it’s inexhaustible because it can’t stop. It’s like a shark that if it stops swimming, it drowns. And there’s a deep transjectivity, there’s a deep participatory identification between the inexhaustible no-thingness in me, and the inexhaustible no-thingness of reality: vast emptiness. The Tao that can be spoken is not the Tao\! And so I can return again and again and again to the world. And again and again and again, there is the real potential, in the world, of sacredness.

## Symbols As Being Indispensable

Now, why might people – now this is a conjecture on my part. I’m trying to offer an explanation and it is not intended to be a justification because that would be inconsistent with what I’m saying – but why is it that we might get this way, where we get ‘this’ \(uses his bottle as an example\), this is where it is to be found\! And this is where I think we do need to be more charitable. Oh man, and I don’t want to sound condescending\! There is a real sense in which particular symbols, particular Mythos, is indispensable for people \(writes indispensable on the board, with Mythos off it\). It might be, and in fact it’s highly plausible if you think about it: given my own personal history, the way Relevance Realization has unfolded, the way Religio is for “here, now, me”, that certain symbols are indispensable for me to activate, articulate, appreciate, accelerate my Religio. Those symbols may be indispensable for me because of the way my Relevance Realization machinery is evolving. They may be indispensable to my Religio because of the Kairos that is always part of my ongoing – see, the problem with ‘Religio’ is it’s a Noun. – but my ongoing Religio – even saying ‘my’ is wrong, right? Because that makes it sound like something I possess; the Religio that my world and I participated in and co-emerge from. It may be to a certain set of individuals that these sets of symbols are indispensable. That makes sense to me. That is how Relevance Realization works.

You may say that only through this Mythos \(draws arrows through Mythos; Fig. 1 arrows\), do I get the access I need to activate, accentuate, appreciate, accelerate, articulate my Religio. I think that is a completely plausible hypothesis. I think, therefore, it makes sense to say, for example, that given the way this person’s evolved fittedness has unfolded, and the particular timing – the historical context – that only this Mythos gives them the access they need. And in that sense – maybe it’s a Christian Mythos, maybe it’s a Hindu Mythos – that Mythos is indispensable to them. But here’s what we shouldn’t do. We shouldn’t confuse ‘indispensable’ to an individual, to a community, to a group, to a tradition. We shouldn’t confuse psycho-cultural, cognitive cultural indispensability with metaphysical necessity. Metaphysical necessity. English is indispensable to me; I cannot communicate to you without it. Given this time, this place, my own history, where we are, the timing of things, English is indispensable to me\! That doesn’t mean that English is metaphysically necessary\! It didn’t exist, and it will not exist at some point\! And it is not some final, complete or absolute version. It is not the perfect language. It is not the final language. In fact, it performs precisely because it’s continually evolving as a language, so that it stays, at least to some degree, in touch with the world.

Fig. 1

## The First Step Towards Solving The Meaning Crisis

I don’t think we should confuse these \(adds ≠ Metaphysical Necessity to the board\); they are not the same. I do not think we should understand the sacred… We shouldn’t do ‘this’ \(writes The Sacred ≠ The Supernatural\). Of course, these are linked \(links The Supernatural with Metaphysical Necessity\). The inexhaustible source of perspectival, participatory, procedural, and ultimately propositional intelligibility \(writes Inexhaustible off The Sacred\). \(Connects Indispensable to Inexhaustible\) We may have, I think it’s reasonable that – in fact I think it’s highly plausible that – a certain Mythos is indispensable for an individual, a group, a community, a tradition. But that should not be confused with metaphysical necessity, nor should it license the idea that that inheres in some supernatural entity or thing \(indicates the link between Metaphysical Necessity and The Supernatural\). The shark, being the way the shark is, is indispensable to the shark’s capacity for survival. But that doesn’t mean that that is the final finished absolute form of fittedness. The world, and the capacity for biological adaptation, the process of evolution, means that there’s an inexhaustibleness to life’s capacity for fittedness. That to me is a reasonable alternative to understanding sacredness, than to think of it as inhering in some final absolute.

So if we could give up the confusion of indispensability with metaphysical necessity, if we could give up identifying The Sacred – that which generates sacredness as the supernatural, then we would not have to be committed to a two-worlds mythology for accessing sacredness, the deep connectedness of Religio. Now that in and of itself is not… well, that’s not the response to the Meaning Crisis. That’s insufficient. That is, and I mean this seriously: This is the first step. The first step is to try to understand the machinery of connectedness and understand it in a way that allows us to disconnect it from a metaphysical essentialism, disconnect it from the supernatural and its commitment to a two-worlds mythology. Instead, understand it in a fashion that is completely integratable with science. Because if you remember, this is all grounded in a naturalistic interpretation of Relevance Realization. This would be an account that re-situates us back within that scientific worldview, while also giving us a way – a deep way – of talking about, experiencing, sacredness, deep connectedness, deep self-transcendence, deep transformation, et cetera. Now I need to do a lot more work. And that’s why this series is not yet finished. I need to show how this model of Relevance Realization does address the historical issues. I’ve already been suggesting that to you, but how does it help to address where we got to historically, the historical factors?

But there’s another thing that I’ve been alluding to, that we also have to address, and they are integrated together. And now that I have this theoretical machinery, I can talk about it better. Because we now have, I think, a more careful way of understanding the meaning crisis \(writes Meaning Crisis on the board\). So we have, and we did this in the first half of the series, we have the historical factors \(writes this off to the side of Meaning Crisis, pointing below it\) that basically have un-homed us, thwarted worldview attunement, all the stuff we’ve been talking about. And of course they need to be addressed. And part of how we can awaken from the meaning crisis is, we have to respond to these historical factors. We have to come up with a way of re-articulating our worldview, in which we can get back that sense of deep connectedness; what I’ve been calling, in the last couple of lectures, sacredness. That kind of deep connectedness that affords the satisfaction of our sense of being in contact with the world, affords self-transcendence, affords meaning in life in a profound way. 

So can this view give us something analogous to what the three orders \[give\]? We’ve got to get to that; that’s how we respond to the historical factors. But you’re starting to see how it might do that. We’re starting to see how we can get an account of sacredness that can fit into the scientific worldview, and fit us back into it. We need to do more on that; you’re getting a beginning of that. But there’s something else now that’s coming to the fore that we need to address \(adds another arrow, mirroring the one from Historical Factors\), which is the structural functional analysis of meaning making – what I’ve been calling the scientific analysis, because I think that’s fair in contrast to the historical analysis – is also disclosing something else. And we’ve seen this all the way along and I’ve been hinting at it. Because the machinery of Meaning Making, of course, also, is the machinery that is going awry when people are experiencing a sense of meaninglessness.

## Perennial Problems

Remember the core argument: that the very machinery that makes you adaptive, is the machinery that makes you vulnerable to self deceptive, self-destructive processing. The very machinery of RR, Relevance Realization \(indicates the convergence point between the two arrows, below Meaning Crisis\), that is making all of this deep connectedness possible for us, is also the machinery that can go horribly wrong. We’ve already seen that. 

I want to start talking about the perennial problems \(labels the second arrow on the right with Perennial Problems\). You’ve seen examples along the way, but I want to bring them out more. I want to develop that thesis about how the very machinery that makes us adaptive is the machinery that makes us prone to self deceptive, self-destructive behaviour. Here’s what I want to argue. I want to argue that all cultures, all people – all people in the sense of being participants in their culture, not necessarily every single individual – but all cultures, across time, place, history. People are prone to perennial problems. These are ways in which the machinery of Relevance Realization can drive them into meaninglessness, despair.

So the idea is that, inherent in the machinery that makes us adaptive, is inescapable vulnerabilities to self-deceptive, self-destructive patterns that can deeply undermine our Religio – the Agent:Arena relationship – such that we experience meaninglessness, absurdity, alienation, et cetera. We fall into despair. These are perennial because they are inherent in our machinery. Now, cultures – and individuals, communities, at multiple scales – what people have developed is they have developed sets of psycho-technologies \(draws a big arrow back up towards Perennial Problems\), ecologies of practices that help alleviate the suffering of these perennial problems. So for example, in India, you have the rise of Buddhism as a set of psycho-technologies for dealing with Duka, et cetera, dealing with modal confusion. Broadly, we have practices for cultivating wisdom and pursuing enlightenment or salvation \(adds these to this big arrow\). The meaning crisis emerges, I would argue, when historical factors have undermined – and that’s what I’ve tried to show you in the history – have undermined a worldview, a tradition; de-legitimized a language, a cognitive grammar; made obsolete or made dismissive practices, sets of psycho-technologies, so that this \(Historical Factors\) undermines this \(puts a big X through Wisdom, Enlightenment, Salvation – See Fig. 2\). The historical factors lead to the undermining of the whole ecology of practices and psycho-technologies and cognitive cultural grammar that people have created in order to respond to the perennial problems.

Fig. 2

So we need to do two things. And now this is where we’re going to start drawing the historical and the scientific together. Is this account that I’m trying to argue for – for Relevance Realization as our meaning making machinery, and for understanding sacredness in terms of Religio, a higher order form of Relevance Realization – can I also use that machinery to give – and I’ve tried to suggest how this is possible – to give a response to the historical factors? \(See Fig. 3\) I’m going to try and do that in terms of what’s called third generation or 4E Cognitive Science. And I’m already doing that. And I’ve already been exemplifying it to you throughout this course.

Fig. 3

## Reverse-Engineering Enlightenment

But right now I want to do something else. I want to take all this machinery of Relevance Realization \(RR\) and Religio and Sacredness \(adds the circle – Fig. 4\) and I want to use it to talk about how we can address the perennial problems.

Fig. 4

I want to do something that’s at the core of a cognitive scientific project. This sounds pretentious and maybe hubristic and I hope it’s not\! I want to reverse-engineer enlightenment. I want to understand what the perennial problems are, and using this machinery \(indicates RR, Religio, Sacredness\), what are the practices \(indicates Wisdom, Enlightenment, Salvation\), what are the processes we can use in order to address the perennial problems? In fact that’s what I’m going to take enlightenment to mean. Enlightenment is the set of practices that ameliorate the perennial problems and alleviate us from the distress and the suffering that they inflict upon us. 

I already suggested the possibility of that when we talked about higher States of consciousness, and trying to give a cognitive scientific account. But now I want to take that deeper. Because to awaken from the meaning crisis is not just to have a theory\! It is not even to have a good scientific historical theory\! It is to have an understanding that helps afford and facilitate the process of transformation that we need to undergo in order to awaken from the meaning crisis. 

I have failed if what I’m doing will not ultimately lead to ways in which you, in your life, can respond to how the perennial problems might be gnawing away at the fabric of meaning in your life. So I want to concentrate on that. I want to concentrate on trying to reverse-engineer enlightenment, and then if I can take that and situate it into this account of sacredness and Relevance Realization and show how that fits into our scientific worldview – and you can see how this \[is\] potentially coming together – then we have a way of awakening from the meaning crisis. Not as an absolute final answer; that’s ridiculous. But as a way of maybe getting the process of awakening from the meaning crisis started.

All right, let’s think of Relevance Realization and Religio… We can think about \[how\] there’s a functional aspect, a structural aspect, and a developmental \[aspect\] \(lists these three on the board – See Fig. 5a\). All of this has been seen throughout the series. Of course the Functional aspect is ultimately the Relevance Realization \[and\] there \[are\] three central features \[of this\]: the way in which it is self-organizing, and then there’s aspects of self-identification and self-reflection. The Structural has to do with the whole Meta-meaning of the Agent:Arena relationship. Developmental: I’ll come back to because I need to unpack these more \(the above two\) before I can talk more about that, but we’ve already seen how an intrinsically developmental Relevance Realization and Religio are.

Fig. 5a

Okay, the self-organizing aspect. How can that go awry? Well, I’ve already made, I think, a very good case for that for you. That’s Parasitic Processing — when we get into those complex cycles that take on a life of their own, and take life from us; complex patterns of self-deception and self-destruction. Self-identification: Well, we know what that is, that’s Modal Confusion. What about Self-reflection? Well, I haven’t talked about that very much, so I need to talk about that now.

## The Problem Of The Reflectiveness Gap

This goes to some important work done by Velleman and others. So we have to go back again to the work of Harry Frankfurt and Frankfurt’s notion of a “Wanton”. A Wanton is a being who acts in a wanton fashion, that acts completely impulsively. And so the idea is, if I just act completely impulsively, I’ll actually lose my agency because my impulses are often in conflict with each other, they undermine each other. Think about Plato and the inner conflict. So what I need to do is I need to step back and reflect in order to try and get a coordination and integration, and reflection actually helps reduce my wantonness. See when I’m enmeshed in a perspective – here’s a particular perspective \(Fig. 6a\) – I am enmeshed in its salience landscape, how it’s making me care, how it’s motivating and arousing me. So when I’m thirsty, I’m seeing the world ‘thirstfully’ right? So things having to do with water \[-\] become salient and I’m drawn \[to them\]. That’s to see the world ‘thirstfully’.

Fig. 6a      Fig. 6b      Fig. 6c

But I can do a transparency-opacity shift. I can actually step to a different perspective in which I’m aware of my thirst \(Fig. 6b\). This perspective is not thirsty \(Fig. 6b 2\). This is thirsty \(Fig. 6b 1\)\! But this perspective \(Fig. 6b 2\), for example, is curious: “Oh, that’s what thirst is like\!” Now my motivational machinery is not driven just by thirst. It is driven by, perhaps, curiosity\! And what happens is, I start to gain some relief from the compulsion of immediacy and urgency of my thirst. I’m using thirst, by the way, because that’s also a metaphor in Buddhism for craving. So if you’re at the bottom, and if you don’t do any self-transcendence, you are awash in impulsiveness, and self-destructive wantonness\! And as I start to move up, away, as I self-transcend, I start to regain agency \(Fig. 6c\). But as you may expect, you can’t simply maximize this, and this is Velleman’s point and it’s an excellent point. As I open up, this is the Reflectiveness Gap. I get a gap by reflection. As I open up this reflectiveness gap, I’m gaining agency. But if I keep opening it up, do I keep enhancing agency? No\! Because then you get into the problem that is typified, beautifully by the way, in one of our great tragedies, namely Hamlet.

Hamlet is always reflecting, and he’s always reflecting on his reflection. And so he’s always stepping back and looking at, always stepping back and looking at. And so he becomes incapable of acting\! His tremendous – because he is gifted. – his tremendous powers of reflection and self-transcendence are actually making him incapable of acting. As Velleman says, he becomes disconnected from the motivational machinery of interacting with the world. He loses agency. See, as I open up – here’s Agency, here’s the Reflectiveness Gap \(R.G.\): as I opened it up, I gain Agency, but as I push it too far, I lose it \(Fig. 7\). Now, of course, you’re tempted to, you know, the Canadian response, “Oh, I’ll just stay in the middle\!” \(Fig. 7 m\). And remember, that never works because how much I need to be towards this end, and how much I need to be towards that end, is going to be very contextually sensitive.

The problem with this is: How do I optimise this? How do I get the involvement, the immersion of the wanton? How do I get the flexibility, the self-correcting capacity of Hamlet? How do I get them together? How do I optimize them together? So this is the problem of the Reflectiveness Gap \(adds this to Fig. 5b below\).

Fig. 5b

And of course, the fact that it’s an optimization problem tells you that it’s immediately enmeshed with Relevance Realization. Remember, there’s tradeoffs, we’ve seen, between exploring and exploiting. There is tradeoffs between generalizing and specializing. Another tradeoff is \[when\] you’re constantly trading between stepping back and looking at your cognition to monitor it, and stepping through and being involved with intervening in the world. There’s a tradeoff relationship between them that’s also part of Relevance Realization.

What about Meta-meaning? Well, there’s three I want to talk about: Absurdity. Anxiety. Alienation \(adds these to the board – Fig. 5c\). All of these, of course, show up in Domicide, because Domicide is the loss of the Agent:Arena relationship.

Fig. 5c

So alienation is when the connectedness between you and other people is lost. Absurdity is when the connectedness between you and the world is lost; and absurdity can be pushed into horror. When you’re finding a particular absurdity deeply mysterious, so it’s drawing you in, such that your ability to make sense and get a grip on the world is being deeply thwarted. That’s horror\! And of course anxiety… remember, it’s not the same as fear. Anxiety is ultimately when you are disconnected from yourself in an important way.

The two problems we face down here \(Developmental\) are ones we’ve talked \[about\] already before. This is Existential Inertia; when you’re trapped in a worldview and you can’t get out of it, you can’t activate Anagoge and move to a new worldview. Or Existential Ignorance; you’re indecisive, you don’t know what you’re going to lose if you go through the transformation, you don’t know what you’re going to miss if you don’t. This is Existential Entrapment \(Fig. 5d\)

Fig. 5d

## Absurdity

So let’s talk a little bit about \[Absurdity\]. I talked a lot about \[Parasitic Processing\] and \[Modal Confusion\], I explained \[Reflectiveness Gap\]. We know a lot about anxiety, the inner conflict. We’ve got aspects of the alienation I’ve been talking about. I’ve talked about \[Existential Entrapment\] already. But \[Absurdity\], which I’ve alluded to many times, we need to talk about this because it points to something really central and important. A very important article on this is by Thomas Nagel, it’s called The Absurd. It’s also talked about in his book, The View From Nowhere. And what I want to try and show you is how much absurdity is a perspectival, participatory \[knowing\]. All of this \(Fig. 5d\) is at the level of perspectival, participatory knowing, but \[Absurdity\] in particular. First of all, Nagel does something very, very important in the absurd. He talks about how we behave as if the absurd is a result of our inferential processing. And we purport to give arguments that lead to the conclusion of absurdity. So we give an argument like, “Well, what I do now doesn’t matter, because it won’t make any difference to people a million years from now.” This is \[the\] “I’m made insignificant by the vast expanse of time”. And Nagel points out that that argument doesn’t work. Because if what’s happening now is irrelevant – notice my language – to people a million years from now, the symmetry applies. Their opinion of me a million years in the future is irrelevant to me\! It is a symmetry. If I make no difference to them, they also should make no difference to me\! It can’t matter to me because I can’t matter to it.

“Well, you know, what, what people are pointing to is, they’re so small. They’re so brief\!” Well, Nagel says, “Well, if you existed for millions and millions of years, would that make your life more meaningful? In fact, isn’t it a very real possibility that existing for a very long period of time would make your life absolutely absurd\!?” 

If your smallness in reality makes you feel absurd, makes you insignificant, then would your life be more meaningful to you if I blew you up to the size of a galaxy? Why would that do anything? And as \[Susan\] Wolf has argued in her book, Meaning In Life And Why It Matters, this sense of being bigger is actually a metaphor for being connected to something larger than oneself. And that’s ultimately a metaphor for being connected to something that has a value independent of my valuing of it. And we’re going to come back to that because that’s at the core of sacredness. Because there’s a problem for all of these \(gesturing to the whole board – Fig. 5d\).

So what’s going on with absurdity? If it’s not really being generated by these arguments, what are the arguments doing? Well, he’s basically saying the arguments are ‘after the fact’ expressions of absurdity, not ‘before the fact’ generators of absurdity. “Well, I might, you know, Whoa, my life is made absurd by the fact that I’m going to die\!” You can’t experience being dead\! How can that be relevant to you? “Well, I won’t exist\!” You didn’t exist a million years ago\! Is that particularly relevant to you? 

Now notice what I’m doing: I’m not trivialising your experience, I’m trying to say that the arguments aren’t generating it because the arguments are ultimately invalid. So let’s drop out of propositional knowing. Don’t we know that that’s right? We’ve had this whole argument that Relevance Realization, the meaning making processes, are below the propositional level, below the level of our inferences and our beliefs. It’s at the level of procedural and ultimately perspectival and participatory knowing.

Let’s take an example. So Nagel gives an example. Now he wrote the article in the 80’s, and that was way before cell phones, and people had voice recorders, which is a very different time\! A very, very different time. But he gives the example of what he calls everyday absurdity, and the example goes like this: Tom is on the phone and he calls – he’s been all day just, “ahhhh, I got to do this, I gotta do this. I’m going to call Susan. I’m going to tell her that I love her. I’ve gotta do it. I’ve been working on this all day here…” working himself up and it’s “Ohhhhh, we got a friendship, but I might be losing a friendship, but I might be gaining a lover…” and all this is happening \(Fig. 5\). So he picks up and calls Susan, dials, he hears the phone picked up, click, and he goes, “Susan, don’t say anything. Don’t say anything at all\! Before you can say anything I have to tell you, I love you. I love you, Susan\!” And then he hears, “Susan is not here right now. Please leave a message at the tone. Beeeeep\!” and it’s kind of funny and it’s kind of sad at the same time\!

Humour can overlap with absurdity\! In fact, you can get a lot of humour by playing with absurdity: Monty Python, you know, those guys, that troop was talented in that\! Because what’s going on in humour points to what’s going on in absurdity. What’s happening is a clash of perspectives. We have Tom’s perspective, and from within his perspective, his action is deeply meaningful. But the machine gives us an impersonal, mechanical perspective in which his actions make no sense. They have no meaning. 

Absurdity is a clash of perspectives. Because, of course, that’s why it overlaps with humour. Because in humour, what you do is you play between a clash of perspectives and then you resolve it by a trick, by an equivocation. You play with two different perspectives. That’s why it’s a ‘punch’ line. You were in this perspective, and then you’re suddenly shifted to this one\! But not in some incongruous way; in a way that you can ultimately make sense of. But of course, absurdity doesn’t always, and very often does not overlap with humour, because the perspectival clash can be one that we can’t ultimately resolve with humour and make sense of. The clash instead is a raw clash of perspectives\! And we experienced just the incoherency, just the loss of connectedness. So absurdity is this clash of perspectives. That’s why it can become horror\! Because this perspective \(gestures holding a small ball\), the perspective that I’m looking at, if I look at this perspective, from the perspective of all of time in history \(gestures a massive ball\), what’s relevant here \(small\), is undermined there \(massive\). There’s a clash in these perspectives.

So what do we need to do? We can see how all of this machinery, all of this \(Fig. 5\), is ways in which the adaptive nature of Religio and Relevance Realization is also making us prey to, vulnerable to losing our agency, to suffering distress, to experiencing horror, meaninglessness, absurdity, being trapped, being deeply confused, overwhelmed by parasitic processing. These are perennial problems, because the very machinery that is making us adaptive is making us always susceptible to them. We can’t jump over our own shadows.

Now, what I want to do next time with you is, can we use the very same machinery of Relevance Realization and see how we could engineer a comprehensive response to all of these perennial problems? Because I would propose to you that any developmental change, any development of our perspectival, participatory and procedural knowing, that affords a response, a reliable response that ameliorates and even alleviates the perennial problems, \[then\] that is a good candidate for enlightenment. Instead of making enlightenment as this unachievable superlative that only the superhuman beings in the distant past can achieve… What’s the use of that\!? Let’s make enlightenment what it… It might be difficult, but let’s not “do that”. Let’s acknowledge the difficulty with an understanding that actually facilitates us being able to respond. I’m going to stipulate that enlightenment is the developmental process that gives us reliable amelioration and alleviation of the perennial problems.

And I’m going to show you next time, how that can be explained with the theoretical machinery of Relevance Realization, and Religion. Thank you very much for your time and attention.

# Ep. 37 – Awakening from the Meaning Crisis – Reverse Engineering Enlightenment: Part 2

Welcome back to Awakening from the Meaning Crisis. So last time we were taking a look at a proposal that we could now understand the sacred, that which causes the experience of sacredness, in terms of a transjective inexhaustibility and kind of deep Anagoge between the no-thingness of your ever evolving Relevance Realization, and its mysterious depths; and the no-thingness of reality that is ultimately combinatorially explosive and dynamically changing itself.

We can acknowledge the important role of the symbolic. The way it helps us to engage and activate the primordial aspects of Religio and go through processes of re-exaptation, causing new emergent abilities so that as we are opening up the world, we are also opening up ourselves in response to that. But I cautioned against confusing indispensability – your own, or our collective, at times, indispensability with any kind of claims of metaphysical necessity, or an absolute essence. And that was part of the larger critique: that relevance can’t have an absolute essence. And therefore we shouldn’t think of the sacred ultimately as a supernaturally endowed, absolutely essential form of relevance.

So I then proposed to you that part of what we saw, at least the experience of sacredness doing was helping to facilitate the higher order Relevance Realization, that meta-realization between homing us against Domicide, the meta-assimilation, but also causing us to confront the numinous, the meta-accommodation. So the Sacred is doing that. But I also proposed that we needed to look at this more deeply. We needed to look at how the Sacred helps us address perennial problems. So that took us into opening up and becoming a little bit more analytic about the Meaning Crisis.

There’s two components to the Meaning Crisis. There are the historical factors, which we traced in detail at the beginning of the first half of the series. And an issue that is now one we need to focus on: the perennial problems. Because, in some sense, the experience of sacredness, the attempt to activate, accentuate, accelerate, articulate, and appreciate Religio, should address our perennial problems. The perennial problems are, of course, perennial because the very machinery of Religio that makes us adaptive, also makes us perpetually vulnerable to self-deceptive, self-destructive behavior.

Most cultures cultivate an ecology of psycho-technologies, typically in the form of a religion for addressing the perennial problems. But that set of psycho-technologies has to be fitted into a legitimizing and sustaining worldview. In some sense, the psycho-technologies have to be integrated with sacredness. What’s of course, happening for us is – and we’ll come back to this in more detail – here, the historical factors have undermined that possibility for us. Undermined the experience of sacredness, all of the ways in which we can cultivate an ecology of psycho-technologies for enhancing Religio, because we do not have a worldview within which that project of meaning making, self-transcendence, the cultivation of wisdom, the affordance of higher states of consciousness, the realization of gnosis… We do not have a worldview that legitimates or encourages that. And so, people are forced, as I said, to cobble together in a dangerously autodidactic fashion, their own personal responses to perennial problems without traditions, guidance, communities, well-worked-out sets of practices, well-vetted, well-developed. And so that means they’re often bereft when they face the perennial problems.

So responding to the Meaning Crisis has two components to it. And that’s why I call it ‘awakening’ from the Meaning Crisis, because it has not only the response of trying to rearticulate a new worldview in which the project of enhancing Religio again, gets validation, is properly situated, encouraged, facilitated, legitimated, et cetera. But we also need to understand what the set of practices the ecology of psycho-technology would look like, that would allow us to address the perennial problems. And I’m proposing that the scientific account of Relevance Realization and Religio – and I’ve already tried to give you some illusions to that… we’re going to come back to it full force – will give us a way of articulating a worldview in which we can resituate the project of meaning making. And of course the linchpin of that argument is the idea that at the core of the meaning making is Relevance Realization, and Relevance Realization can be given a naturalistic explanation. One that, hopefully, still does full justice to the experience of sacredness.

But I want to concentrate, as we began last time, on the perennial problems. Because, ultimately, that’s the final thing. If I come up with a historical response and it does not actually afford the addressing of the perennial problems, that helps people to ameliorate and perhaps alleviate the perennial problems, then this project has failed. So we need to start discussing the perennial problems and developing this thesis more extensively – that the very machinery that makes us adaptive, makes us susceptible to self-deceptive, self-destructive patterns of behavior.

## Different Aspects Of Religio

So we talked about looking at some of the core features of Religio. So we’ve got functional features \(writes Functional – Self-organization\) \(Fig. 1\), and here we have, of course, self-organization; and I tried to develop that very explicitly. It’s not just vague self-organization it’s opponent processing. Opponent processing that’s making use of self-organizing criticality, the relationship between compression, particularization, and other such tradeoff relationships, et cetera. We’ve got self-identification \(writes Self-identification below Self-organization\), that process by which you’re creating an identity; and you’ve got self-reflection \(writes Self-reflection below Self-identification\), your ability to step back and reflect on your own cognition, which, of course, was made so powerfully present in the Axial Revolution with the advent of second-order thinking.

Fig. 1

We took a look at the structural \(writes Structural\). This has to do with the components of the Agent:Arena relationship. The ways in which self is connected to the world \(writes Self-world beside Structural\), self is connected to self \(writes Self-self below Self-world, and self is connected to others \(writes Self-others below Self-self\).

And then we looked at the developmental \(writes Developmental\). And I sort of left that as a placeholder, because I just wanted to give a quick overview last time, but I want to go in and draw this together. Because what we’ve been talking about throughout the last few lectures is the idea that your cognition is inherently developmental. It functions by developing; it develops by functioning. So because it’s inherently self-organizing, it develops by functioning \(writes Develops by functioning beside Developmental\). It functions by developing \(writes Functions by developing below Develops by functioning\), and this is qualitative development. What I mean is you get the capacity for self-transcendence. There’s not only an increase in what you know, but an increase in the kinds of things you can know, the kinds of things you can do. And this is ultimately some kind of process of optimization \(writes Optimization below Functions by developing\). So there’s a developmental trajectory.

And then what you can see is some of the problems we’ve already talked about: the parasitic processing \(writes Parasitic Processing beside Self-organization\). In the notes for this lecture, I will put references to the previous lectures, in which I have talked about these in detail. So in order to avoid useless repetition, you can go back and look at the presentation. But if you remember, there’s a bad event, and it spirals off, and it gets this very complex self-organizing system that takes on a life of its own, becomes very adaptively resistant to our attempts at intervention, et cetera.

Okay, so this is modal confusion \(writes Modal Confusion beside Self-identification\). Okay. This is from, but very much you can also see it being addressed by, the Stoics. You can see it being addressed by Buddhism, as Bachelor argues. This is to get into confusion between the Having and the Being modes, the kind of “I” that you are; are you in an “I:it”, “I:thou” et cetera.

Self-reflection, last time we talked about this \(writes Reflectiveness Gap beside Self-reflection\). This is the reflectiveness gap. This comes from the fact that what we can do is we can step back and look at our own processing. And this affords us, this gap affords us, regaining our agency from the chaos of being the impulsive Wanton. But when we open up the reflectiveness gap too much, we get also a loss of agency, we get the tragedy of Hamlet and, of course, some middling position is not the answer there, because at times you have to be highly reflective, at times you have to be highly immersed. How do we answer that?

The problem here with the Self-World relationship is absurdity \(writes Absurdity beside Self-world\). As I said, this is the Agent:Arena relationship \(writes Agent-Arena below Structural\). And we talked about absurdity here, and made clear that all of the arguments for absurdity, like what happens a million years from now, it doesn’t matter. “I’m so small, I will die.” None of these things actually are arguments that can legitimately lead to a conclusion of absurdity, because they are, in many ways – and this was Nagel’s point – they’re just bad arguments\! They’re just fallacious arguments.

Now, dismissing the arguments is not to dismiss the person who makes the argument. I hope I made that clear last time\! If not, I’m trying to do that now, because people are trying to articulate with these pseudo-arguments, something real that is happening to them, something that is very important. So the arguments are after-the-fact expressions rather than the generators. And the main theme here, and this of course goes into right… \(writes Clash of perspectives beside Absurdity\) You can see how all of this \(indicates parasitic processing, modal confusion, reflectiveness gap\) is our perspectival, participatory ways of being, ways of knowing. But what’s here \(back to absurdity\) is a clash of perspectives. It’s a clash of perspectives. And then we did the example of Tom who’s calling Susan, and how we’ve humored that clash of perspectives can be resolved usually by playing, like equivocating, between terms or meanings, or getting people to make a connection they hadn’t made before. But in absurdity – and I think there’s an overlap like this \(Fig. 2\) \(draws two overlapping circles\) where you have humor \(circle on the left\) as a resolvable clash of perspectives, and then you have absurdity here \(circle on the right\). And then there’s an overlap zone \(shades in the overlap\). And like I said, there’s a lot of humor \[here\] \(indicating the shaded overlap\) – my prototypical example, \[which\] tells my age, when I was growing up is the humor of Monty Python, in which you get a lot of absurdity. But then you get what becomes \[an\] irresolvable clash \(shades in the absurdity/circle on the right\); it’s undermining Religio in some way, undermining your Agency in some way. And that’s sort of pure absurdity.

Fig. 2

Self with Self \(back to Fig. 1\): this goes back to what we talked about with Tillich and anxiety, inner conflict, and what we need here is to, again, think about the ways in which this is connected to self-deception. Because the inner conflict – remember Plato – often skews your salience landscape and makes you susceptible to bullshitting. I’ll talk about bullshitting in connection to this, overall. Of course, this is alienation \(writes Alienation beside Self-others\). This is our inability to connect to other people. Something that is often exacerbated through social media by the way these other perennial problems in self-deceptive behavior can be magnified in social media. So we can be modally confused and think \[that\] by having a lot of connections, we’re overcoming our alienation and loneliness, but of course that’s not the case. We can exacerbate the social media by falling into a sort of pretend narrative and things like that.

Here we talked about existential inertia \(writes Existential Inertia beside Develops by function and Functions by developing\). This is when you need to move between worldviews, make a worldview viable that you’re not currently in. We’re going to talk a lot more about the work of Agnes Callard and aspiration. But the point here, and going back again to the seminal work of LA Paul, \[is that\] this is basically a need for Anagoge. How do I Anagoge my way out of this worldview into another worldview? And then of course there’s existential ignorance \(writes Existential Ignorance below Existential Intertia\), a point made salient by LA Paul and also picked up by Agnes Callard in her book on Aspiration, that we can’t reason our way through this. We can’t infer our way from a weaker logic to a stronger logic. We can’t infer, we can’t propositionally come up with the perspectival knowledge that we’re lacking, with the participatory knowing that we do not currently possess, and the identity that we are not currently cultivating. So all of that, of course, can come together and this was mythologized – and I mean that in a complimentary sense. Remember how I’m using Mythos – but this is mythologized by the Gnostics of “existential entrapment,” feeling trapped.

Now, a couple of things before we move towards starting to address this. This is analytic. This is for theoretical purposes that these things are being distinguished and laid out. It is often the case, as I’ve already tried to indicate, that these things are interacting and exacerbating each other. That you can be experiencing absurdity and it can be really contributing to your existential inertia. Right? You could be overthinking things, and getting sort of stuck, and that might be also contributing to your existential ignorance, or it might be contributing to your modal confusion because you can’t remember the Being mode because you caught up in having a lot of thoughts and trying to have a lot of beliefs. I’m not going to try and map this out, because the permutations of the ways in which these interact and afford and exacerbate each other is very complex, which, of course, is why the perennial problems are so pressing on people.

Now, what I want to try and do is to show you…\(hesitates\!\) I want to try and show you how we can salvage from the legacy, so many psycho-technologies for addressing the Meaning Crisis. The reason why I’m hesitating is because, again, I’m – this, this is genuine – I am, there’s a hubristic element here and I’m not just trying to say, “Oh, you know, taking it from you and leaving that behind”\! But again, I’m trying to get a balance between respecting where we really are and what our situation really is and respecting all of the tremendous heritage and legacy that has been given to us, and trying to get that balance is always in my mind. It’s very difficult\! But, I’m going to go through these, each one… First of all I’m just going to name so you can get an overall schematic and then I’ll erase the board and I’ll talk about each one in greater detail. Okay, so be patient, please, I’m asking for your patience. I’m just going to give some indications about how we address each one of these schematically so you can see on the board and then I’ll step back and go through each one in more detail. And then, how they’re integrated together. And what’s also missing from this, in an important sense.

## Ways Of Addressing The Perennial Problems

So what I’m going to propose here is the way you deal with parasitic processing is – and this is why this is number one, in some sense, schematically; it’s overarching. You’ve heard me talk about it before with the idea of an ecology of practices, an ecology of psycho-technologies. What you want to do is you want to cultivate a counteractive dynamical system. See, Parasitic Processing is a very complex dynamical system, and if you try and do one shot interventions, it just reconfigures itself. What you need is to internalize… It can’t just be something you think about it; it can’t just be some ideological structure. It has to actually be an active dynamical system in you. And so what you’re going to do – and again, I’ll come back to this in more detail – you’re going to try and cultivate a counteractive dynamical system, because that is how you will be able to respond to the dynamical systems of Parasitic Processing. And I’m going to propose to you that a prototypical – by no means exclusive\! So that’s how I’m using it – but a prototypical example of this is the cultivation of the eightfold path in Buddhism \(Fig. 3\) \(draws a wheel beside Parasitic Processing on the board\), which is very, very perspicaciously represented by an eight spoke wheel; the integration, it revolves, it evolves, et cetera. So what we’re looking for here is a Counteractive Dynamical System \(writes Counteractive D.S. on the board\).

Fig. 3

Modal Confusion \(writes Sati beside Modal Confusion\): we’ve already talked about this and this is Sati. Practices that are designed to invoke a deep remembrance of the Being Mode.

The Reflectiveness Gap: you need the combination, the integration, the dynamic integration. Not just a settled median point, you need the dynamic integration of immersion and creative flexibility. We know a state that does that, we’re going to come back to this \(writes Flow beside the Reflectiveness Gap\), but that’s the Flow state. You need to be cultivating the flow state in an important way.

Clash of Perspectives: this is going to take – again, so what I put on the board right now, initially, it’s going to seem like “what?”; so again, give me some time. I’m just going to put it on here – this is what Spinoza in the West called ‘scientia intuitiva’, or what in Buddhism in the East refers to as Prajñā. This is a state, in which you get the deep interpenetration of the perspectives. Alright, so I’m just going to put \[it\] up here \(writes Scientia Intuitiva beside clash of perspectives\), and you’re like, “wow, what does that mean? How you do that?”\! Scientia intuitiva, Prajñā \(writes Prajñā beside Scientia Intiuitiva\)… but if you remember, just to foreshadow it, we talked about \[how\] I can scale down, I can scale up, and then I can get this state of non-duality that is simultaneously scaling up and scaling down. And that actually alleviates the clash of perspectives. So we’ll come back to this.

Anxiety: this is inner dialogue \(writes Inner Dialogue beside Anxiety\). So this is to pick up the idea of internalizing the Sage: as the child is to the adult, the adult is to the sage. So an example of this is the Christian’s “it’s not I who lives, but Christ who lives in me”, or the Buddhist’s “you have to realize your Buddha nature”, or the Stoics’ “I have to internalize Socrates”. And again, if you turn these into ideas to be believed rather than practices that have actually been internalized and are integrated into the development of your identity, then you’re not hearing what I’m saying\!

Alienation: I haven’t talked as much about this, but I’m going to come back to this more. This is to cultivate what Turner \(writes Communitas beside Alienation\) and other people called Communitas. This is the sense of connectedness to other. And part of that is to try and recover what we had in Platonic dialogue. And what’s happening right now is a whole movement called Authentic Discourse; I’m going to talk a lot more about that – the Authentic Discourse Movement. Something like what we had in Platonic dialogue, something like therapy, sort of “both/ beyond”; I’ll come back to that, because this is a primary way of doing this \(indicates Alienation\). 

I gave you an extended argument \(draws an arrow beside Existential Entrapment\) for how you respond to Existential Entrapment, and of course this is Gnosis \(writes Gnosis beside the arrow\) and that this Gnosis is going to have a connection to higher states of consciousness \(HSC\) \(writes HSC below Gnosis\).

There’s something that’s missing. And what’s missing is, we need, of course, an overall framing of these things, the way we’re pursuing all of these, and the way we’re trying to integrate them together. All of this \(draws a bracket on the left side of the diagram\) has to be within a Wisdom framing. We’re going to talk more explicitly \(writes Wisdom beside the bracket\); we’re going to devote quite a bit of time to try and get at what can we now think about wisdom, given all the current work within psychology and cognitive science, and even neuroscience, on wisdom. \(Fig. 4\). Because throughout all of this, we have to have a cognitive style in which the amelioration of self-deception and the affordance of self-optimization are paramount. Okay? So I want to go through each one of these in more detail. This is the overarching structure, and then trying to bring it together…

## Reverse Engineering Enlightenment

What is it I’m proposing to you? And see, here’s where my concern about hubris is here, although I think there is a legitimate point I’m making. I’m trying to argue for a way in which we can reverse engineer enlightenment. Instead of keeping enlightenment as an obscure state surrounded by mystique and nostalgia, we need an account that recognizes what that mystique pointed to, but exaggerates, which is the difficulty of enlightenment. Right?

But ultimately, if we have a kind of Being, an ecology or psycho-technology that reliably and systematically, individually and collectively, allows us to address the perennial problems, I’m going to propose to you that that’s what we should call Enlightenment. If enlightenment is something above and beyond that, then I don’t know what its value is. And if enlightenment is not directed towards this \(gestures towards the board\), I would say it is not something of value. So I’m going to propose to you that, insofar as we can give – using the theoretical tools we’ve cultivated together; Relevance Realization, the work we’ve done on mindfulness, the work we’ve done on flow, et cetera, all of it \(gestures towards the board\) – insofar as we can give an account of this in terms that are ultimately naturalistic, that can be subject to scientific investigation, we will have – and is this the final ‘challenge’ to the division given to us in the Enlightenment? – we will have a scientific theory of enlightenment and what it can mean for us. 

## Cultivating A Counteractive Dynamical System

Some of these, I’ll talk about it at length because they’re more novel; others, I’ll talk about more briefly because there’s an extended discussion of them. So again, let’s start with this notion of dealing with Parasitic Processing, which is an overarching thing. And the idea here is, as I said: to cultivate a set of practices, and that’s what you have with something like the eightfold path \(draws a wheel\) \(Fig. 5\) where you’re trying to remember all of these: right aspiration, right mindfulness, right concentration, et cetera. Remember that the “right” is not moral righteousness; the right is “right-handedness,” it’s dexterity. And now to use language that we’ve developed: it’s “right-fittedness,” it’s optimal fittedness. It’s enhanced Relevance Realization within each one of these. And what you have is a set of practices that are interdependent with each other, mutually supporting, and self-rolling, becoming a self-rolling wheel. And if I have a set of practices that can take on a life of its own, and you have the metaphors in Buddhism like where you enter the stream, it takes on a life of its own. And initially what I’m doing is, I’m cultivating this practice and this practice and this practice – but then they start to implicitly interact, reinforce, develop, and it starts to become a counteractive dynamical system in me.

Fig. 5

The Buddha told the famous parable about how to understand this \(indicates Fig. 5\). He talks about the goldsmith; gold is something inherently valuable, and you should think of your mind as something inherently valuable. And he says, okay, so take a look at the goldsmith. The goldsmith just looks at the gold; no change is wrought. So if you’re just sort of doing meditation and reflecting, nothing happens. The goldsmith has to heat up the gold. There has to be this right effort, energy put in, maybe something like flow. But if the goldsmith just heats up the gold, the gold just melts and goes away. And then also there has to be the shaping. There has to be the reconfiguration. There has to be the cultivation of new skills, new abilities, new virtues. If you just hammer the gold, you’ll smash it and wreck it. If you just heat it, it will melt. If you just look at it, you will do nothing but notice its imperfections, but nothing will change.

So I need to look in order to notice, but I need to balance that, integrate that dynamically with heating and with hammering – and notice what I’m doing: I’m creating this higher order skill of being a smith by getting a set of practices that have a complementary relationship to them. Each one has strengths and weaknesses, and the strengths and weaknesses are fitted together. So you get something overall that can produce something that the individual skills can’t do. So by getting this fluid ecology of looking, of heating, and of shaping, then the gold becomes well-shaped, and it becomes, as he says, wieldy. You can wield it very well. It fits your hand and extends your capacity so well.

So what you’re getting there is a strong recommendation for looking at this as cultivating an ecology of practices, getting sets of practices, sets of psycho-technologies that have complementary relationships to each other, and organizing them together. And we do this all the time.We constantly take constellations of lower order skills and techniques to build higher order skills and techniques, but we build it as a dynamical system, the counteractive dynamical system that can operate in many ways, on many levels of our cognition and our consciousness and our being. So the way to deal with parasitic processing is to cultivate a counteractive dynamical system. And this is why this is an overarching thing.

## Remembering Sati

Modal Confusion — We’ve already talked about this. We’ve already talked about the way in which mindfulness practices and other practices like that can be drawn from stoicism. Like the view from above, or objective seeing, can help us to remember Sati, the Being-mode. Again, not as an idea, not as a belief, but as an existential mode that we can reliably reactivate and reenter into in a viable and enriching manner.

## Getting Into The Flow State

The Reflectiveness Gap and Flow — So if I were to just speak this lecture impulsively, wantonly, it’ll become chaotic. It’ll tend to probably fall into self-contradiction. It will be confused, and therefore confusing. But if I’m constantly stepping back and reflecting on what I’m saying and engaging in self-criticism, and then thinking – I’ll choke.

So what do I do? Well, I try to get into the flow state because the flow state is a state in which I am both – and Velleman, by the way, argues for something very similar, he proposes Taoism and Taoism as a solution to the reflectiveness gap. And, of course, as I’ve argued, Taoism is basically the religion of flow in many ways, the yin and yang, the out and the in, the making frame and breaking frame, et cetera. So what you’re trying to do is set up the practices that will afford flow, set up the conditions that will afford flow. And remember, we talked about the right kinds of conditions. And also – and this is where we’re going to have to come back to wisdom – wisely cultivate your flow; where and when and in what domains are you learning to flow?

So I’m trying to get into the flow state here that will keep me sort of immersed and engaged with the material, but also, make me, hopefully, very flexible, and capable when needed. I don’t mean to be self-congratulatory, but you know, when it’s needed, hopefully insightful, that this is not just mechanical, that there’s an element of flow to it. Almost like jazz; jazz with concepts, and jazz with argumentation.

## Practicing Prajña

Okay. So let’s come back to absurdity and come back to Prajñā again. We did talk about this before, but I want to remind you of it, and that you are very capable of this. Because your cognition is capable, because of the way attention works. Because attention, I’ve put it up multiple times – the cat and everything. Your attention is simultaneously bottom-up from the features, and top-down from the Gestalt. And your attention – the way you are related to the world is one in which the world and you can be co-creating. This is actually something that Spinoza talks quite a bit about in The Ethics. How your experience is co-created by the body and by the world.

So if you remember, Spinoza talks about this idea. When you’re reading an argument, and his whole book The Ethics is an attempt to bring back blessedness and a sense of, I would argue, sacredness within a Cartesian scientific worldview. That’s why it’s called The Ethics. It means ethics in the older sense of becoming the best person leading the best kind of life, not just doing the morally correct thing. But Spinoza talks about this kind of knowing. And what I realized when I was reading The Ethics – well, studying the ethics, you have to almost do Lectio Divina with The Ethics. You have to read it. You have to really let it soak into you. You have to try and get that worldview attuned – what’s it like to see the world as Spinoza did? So you have to study and practice The Ethics. So it’s an extended period. And he talks about this. I realized that the ethics was actually designed to do this. You have this tremendously tight logical structure, but the logical structure is trying to afford what he called scientia intuitiva, a deeply intuitive knowing.

And what he means by that is that you’ve got this tremendous argument that reaches up to the sort of largest scale of reality. But there’s individual premises along the way. And the idea here is – here’s the analogy \(Fig. 6\). So the premises are like the letters \(writes Premises – Letters\). And the argument of arguments, all the arguments constellated together \(writes Meta-argument\). So I’m going to call this the Meta-argument. So these \(indicates Premises\) go up into arguments \(draws an upward arrow from Premises and writes Arguments above\) and then the arguments \(draws an arrow from Argument to Meta-Arguments\) go up into the meta-argument. And this \(draws an upward arrow from letters\) of course is like the words \(writes words beside the upward arrow\) into sentences kind of thing \(writes sentences above the upward arrow\). Remember we talked about how your attention is multiply-layered in this way. And what can happen is, if you practice The Ethics, you get to a place where you see the whole of the argument, the meta-argument, in each premise \(draws an arrow from Meta-argument to Premises\), and you see how each premise and each argument fit into and contribute to the whole \(draws an arrow from Premises to Meta-argument\), just like you’re seeing the words in terms of the sentence, and the letters in terms of the words. And it’s simultaneously bottom-up and top-down in a completely interpenetrating fashion. You get a cosmic perspective that is interpenetrating with the perspective of your individual moment of thought. That’s scientia intuitiva. There is a complete interleaving of the perspectival knowing.

Fig. 6

The Buddhists talk about something similar to this: Prajñā, a kind of self-liberating state of wisdom. And it’s a state, in which, as DT Suzuki says, you’re sort of simultaneously looking as deeply *in* as you can, and simultaneously looking *out* as deeply as you can. And he quotes Eckhart, a Christian Neoplatonist, as a way of explaining this: “The eye by which I see God is the same eye by which God sees me.” So the perspective that reaches out and upwards to what’s ultimate, is the same as the perspective that is coming deeply into me. And what you get is, you practice sort of scaling down as deeply as you possibly can towards something like the pure consciousness event, and scaling down. And you practice scaling up to this sense of profound resonant at-one-ment with everything. And then what happens is, in practice, you’re alternating between them. But then, as I mentioned, what eventually happens is you get non-duality. You’re simultaneously as deeply in, and as deeply down – sorry for these metaphors – as you can be. But as I said, they’re often indispensable. You’re simultaneously as deeply down and as deeply in, and as simultaneously as out and as up as you can be. You’re sort of at maximal breaking frame and maximal making frame, and they are optimally, dynamically integrated, like they are in the most optimal, profound insight you can have.

So that state \(indicates Prajñā\) is a place that addresses absurdity. And you say, “But it doesn’t answer any of the arguments for absurdity.” But that’s the point. There is no argumentative response to absurdity, because the arguments that are supposed to be generating absurdity, don’t generate absurdity. They’re after-the-fact expressions of absurdity. What drives absurdity is perspectival clash. And you can reliably realize a state in which you overcome the perspectival clash. And remember, you can overcome lower order perspectival clash in humor; and humor has at the core of it, a kind of insight and a kind of joy in that insight. You can have something like that. There’s a continuum. You can have the overcoming of the perspectival clash with this Prajnic state of non-duality that carries with it a kind of joy, a kind of insight, a kind of scientia intuitiva, a deep, intuitive knowing. And so that is very doable for us. 

## Indwelling The Sage

Anxiety — So what anxiety is about is, there’s a nebulous sense that something is wrong, and it’s connected to inner conflict. We see this in Christianity, the inner conflict of Paul. We see it in Plato with the inner conflict. There’s different centers working according to different goals, and they’re at war with each other, and we suffer. And it’s a dramatic sense of threat. But it has no specific target, of course, as fear does, because with anxiety, the threat is endemic to you. So no matter where you go, you’re sensing the threat, but there’s nothing that the threat can particularly attach to, because the threat has to do with the state of being at war within yourself.

So we see across the traditions, the idea of internalizing the sage, to create an inner dialogue that helps to coordinate the various centers, gets them to talk to each other. And I think this is something where cognitive science can actually give us tremendous help. We’ve had a lot of increase in our knowledge of the various different areas of cognition, even different kinds of centers processing in the brain, and how they work, and how they’re operating. And what we need is an internalized representation. A model. A role model. A role is a way of taking on a new identity. We need a role model for how we can engage in dialogue. And the proposal here – which is, of course, the platonic proposal we already saw – that if I can internalize my capacity - developed by the Stoics - my capacity to interact with the sage, eventually I get that ability that I have only with the sage. I can have it with myself, within myself. And it means, therefore, that it becomes part of my metacognitive machinery, the way I dialogue with myself, and get the various aspects of myself, the very centers, to dialogue with each other. And you can see various versions of this. You can see Jung’s use of active imagination as a way of trying to create an inner dialogue between different centers of the psyche. You can see practices like Lectio Divina, where I am reading the text, and I am trying to get the text to speak to me, is also allowing aspects of the different aspects of the psyche to talk to each other through the text. So there is a lot we can do.

So, as I mentioned to you, the process of identification \(writes Identification\), where you’re identifying with something like the sage, obviously makes use of our capacity for internalizing the perspective of others \(Fig. 7\) \(draws an arrow from Identification and writes Internalization below it\), but it also requires what Polanyi called the capacity for indwelling \(draws an arrow from Identification and writes Indwelling below it\). So remember indwelling is when \(taps his whiteboard marker against the whiteboard eraser\) I’m proceeding through the pen, I’m indwelling it. So you not only have to internalize the sage, but you have to indwell – you have to practice and that fits within with others – to practice trying to… what does it look like? What is it like to see things the way the sage does? You have to seriously play at being the sage, without pretense or arrogance or inflation.

Fig. 7

That’s why wisdom is going to matter to all of this. So I practice indwelling the sage. Ask: what would Socrates do? What would Aristotle do? What would Jesus do? And you have to regularly practice. So you practice indwelling, and then you practice internalizing; and you practice indwelling, and then you practice internalizing. And that is \(indicating Fig. 7\) how you basically start to afford the internalization of the sage, and the creation of your ability, as Antisthenes said, what he learned from Socrates so long ago: to converse with yourself, to get, to enter into something like platonic dialogue with yourself.

## Participating In Communitas

Alienation — So alienation takes us towards something talked about by Émile Durkheim and Victor Turner and others: Communitas \(writes Communitas\). Communitas is what you feel when you’re watching with other people – what’s happened recently, the Toronto Raptors, and everybody was gathered together, and we have shared attention, and we are getting in sync together, and we have that sense of communing and communicating with each other. And there is a shared spirit amongst us all. That’s communitas. Communitas is basically a way of getting collective flow going, but it’s also something else. It’s a collective flow in which we feel like there is real communication between people and something deeper. There’s real communion. There’s a sense of participating in a shared identity of some kind. So this has to do with taking a careful look at the way in which our practices of communication and communing have been so undermined by bullshitting and modal confusion and an adversarial political culture, et cetera.

And so what’s been happening… as I said, part of the gift of the video series is, I’ve gotten to meet more and more people who are trying to do this. They’re trying to – they’re putting real time and talent into cultivating individual and communal responses to the Meaning Crisis. So I’ve gotten to interact with, for example, Peter Limberg, who’s been introducing me to authentic discourse, authentic relating practices. I will talk a little bit about this in a minute. 

And also Jordan Hall, who’s trying to do two things in an integrated fashion. He’s trying to free communication from the cultural grammar that has got us where we are. In that sense, he’s trying to respond deeply to the history, not in theory, but in the actual practice. 

And that is bound up with, as my argument has tried to show, that is bound up with the project of trying to reaccess, in a powerful and perspicacious manner, these other kinds of knowing; and that making our communication or our communion not just a matter of propositional exchange or conflict, but trying to tap into the underlying procedural knowing. And how that procedural knowing is dependent on the underlying perspectival situational awareness, and how that is ultimately dependent on the participatory process of our ongoing evolving attunement from which the agent and the arena co-emerge. And so I see him trying to do that. I see him trying to create a way in which we can get what he calls coherence. A kind of communitas, I would say, that is directed towards engaging the collective intelligence of distributed cognition; and remember that most of our real world problem solving, contrary to the bullshit we tell ourselves about how we’re self-made individuals, most of our problem solving is done in concert – serious play, concert music – is done in concert with other people. And so what he is trying to do is create a stance towards a state called coherence in which we are creating a kind of communitas that is marshaling distributed cognition and its collective intelligence for simultaneously freeing us from the ways in which we are boxed in, like the nine dot problem, by our historical, cultural, cognitive grammar. Access the other kinds of knowing, and bring that to bear on the problems that we are facing.

So I want to talk a little bit, I’ll just introduce the idea. There’s a book, *Cohering the Integral We Space: Enabling Collective Emergence, Wisdom and Healing in Groups*. I’ve gone to a circling practice already. I’m not an expert in it. I want to become one. I want to take it seriously. So I’m only gesturing towards it, but it is a communal practice in which – this is my best way of trying to explain it to – you’re engaging in a mindfulness practice, something like platonic dialogue. And you’re creating something like a collective flow state, so that what emerges is a dynamical system. And as I basically have been proposing throughout the last few lectures, that the word Spirit is basically pointing towards dynamical systems that are evolving.

We create a dynamical system that gives people the resources to address their capacity for being in touch with themselves in each other. It’s not therapy, although it overlaps with some of the gnosis in therapy as well. You know this, you know that when things are right and you get in sync with another person or another group of people – and we talked about this with platonic dialogue – something emerges. There’s a collective that emerges there that takes your cognition, and everybody else’s, to places that you can’t go individually. You participate in that, but you don’t make it. You’re not just a passive recipient of it. You’re not just a patient of it. You’re participating in it. And so I want to learn more about this, but there is a growing – and the circling practice overlaps with other practices that Peter and I are learning about, where Peter talks about a process he calls the anti-debate, where we turn adversarial debating, we have techniques for turning it into authentic relating, where we’re trying to get insight, rather than victory in our debating processes. There’s lots of books coming out on this, like *Verbal Aikido* and *Verbal Judo*. So there is the beginning of a whole set of practices for bringing about authentic discourse that can really address the issues of alienation. 

## Gnosis

Now, of course, as I said, the response to existential entrapment is gnosis, and we had extended discussion about that and its interconnection with higher states of consciousness. So I’m not going to talk about that at great length, please go back and look at that gnosis. But what I would say is that gnosis seems to need, and you see this with Jeepform and you see this in therapy. It needs that open-ended mythos that the Gnostics talked about. I’m not advocating their particular mythos. I’m not saying their metaphysics is correct – but that transgressive, the open-ended ongoing symbol, the ongoing mythos, these seem to be needed for the cultivation of gnosis. And so I would recommend that to you.

So what I want to do next time is come back and put this all together, what it looks like, and then start talking about the overall framing of this, the way we frame, how we cultivate the individual psycho-technologies, the individual practices, and how we constellate the ecology of those in a state of enlightenment within a wisdom framing.

Thank you very much for your time and attention.
