# Cross-Domain Integration Framework

**Labels:** phase-2, integration, cross-domain
**Phase:** Phase 2
**Priority:** Medium
**Estimated Effort:** 14-18 days

## Description

Develop a comprehensive framework for integrating cognitive processing across different domains and modalities. This includes unified representation systems, cross-domain reasoning, and seamless knowledge transfer between specialized cognitive subsystems.

The integration framework should enable the system to leverage knowledge and capabilities from one domain to enhance performance in others, creating synergistic effects across the cognitive architecture.

## Tasks

- [ ] Design unified representation framework for cross-domain concepts
- [ ] Implement cross-modal attention and integration mechanisms
- [ ] Create domain adaptation and alignment algorithms
- [ ] Develop abstract concept mapping between domains
- [ ] Add cross-domain reasoning and inference capabilities
- [ ] Implement knowledge graph integration across modalities
- [ ] Create domain-specific to general knowledge translation
- [ ] Add validation for cross-domain knowledge consistency

## Acceptance Criteria

- Unified representations enable seamless cross-domain reasoning
- Cross-modal integration improves multi-sensory task performance
- Domain adaptation maintains 90% accuracy across different contexts
- Abstract concept mapping enables knowledge generalization
- Cross-domain reasoning produces logically consistent results
- Knowledge graphs integrate information from multiple domains effectively
- Domain translation preserves semantic meaning and relationships

## Dependencies

- Meta-learning systems
- Enhanced cognitive capabilities
