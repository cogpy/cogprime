# Vervaeke Framework Components Integration

**Labels:** phase-3, vervaeke-framework, 4e-cognition
**Phase:** Phase 3
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Effort:** 16-20 days

## Description

Integrate John Vervaeke's 4E cognition framework components into the CogPrime architecture. This includes implementing embodied, embedded, enacted, and extended cognition principles that enhance the system's contextual awareness and meaning-making capabilities.

The integration should preserve the theoretical rigor of Vervaeke's framework while making it computationally tractable within the existing cognitive architecture.

## Tasks

- [ ] Implement embodied cognition principles in sensorimotor processing
- [ ] Add embedded cognition context awareness mechanisms
- [ ] Create enacted cognition active perception systems
- [ ] Develop extended cognition tool use and environmental coupling
- [ ] Integrate salience landscape navigation algorithms
- [ ] Implement perspectival and participatory knowing frameworks
- [ ] Add transformative and conformative processing modes
- [ ] Create cognitive-emotional integration following Vervaeke's model

## Acceptance Criteria

- Embodied cognition improves sensorimotor integration and spatial reasoning
- Embedded cognition enables context-sensitive behavior adaptation
- Enacted cognition supports active perception and exploration strategies
- Extended cognition effectively utilizes environmental affordances
- Salience landscape navigation guides attention and action selection
- Perspectival knowing enables multiple viewpoint integration
- Transformative processing facilitates insight and creative problem-solving
- Cognitive-emotional integration enhances decision-making quality

## Dependencies

- Phase 2 completion
- Vervaeke framework documentation
