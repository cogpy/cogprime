# Resource Management System

**Labels:** phase-4, resource-management, scheduling
**Phase:** Phase 4
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Effort:** 14-18 days

## Description

Develop sophisticated resource management capabilities that dynamically allocate computational resources, memory, and attention based on current cognitive demands and system constraints. This includes priority-based scheduling, resource monitoring, and adaptive allocation strategies.

The resource management system should ensure optimal utilization of available resources while preventing resource conflicts and maintaining system stability under varying computational loads.

## Tasks

- [ ] Design dynamic resource allocation architecture
- [ ] Implement priority-based computational scheduling
- [ ] Create memory management with garbage collection optimization
- [ ] Add attention resource allocation algorithms
- [ ] Implement adaptive load balancing across cognitive modules
- [ ] Create resource monitoring and alerting systems
- [ ] Add resource constraint handling and graceful degradation
- [ ] Implement resource usage prediction and preallocation

## Acceptance Criteria

- Dynamic allocation responds to changing computational demands within 1ms
- Priority scheduling ensures critical cognitive operations complete on time
- Memory management prevents leaks and optimizes usage patterns
- Attention allocation maximizes cognitive effectiveness given resource constraints
- Load balancing maintains system responsiveness under high load
- Monitoring provides real-time visibility into resource utilization
- Graceful degradation maintains core functionality under resource pressure
- Prediction systems enable proactive resource management

## Dependencies

- Performance optimization
- System monitoring
