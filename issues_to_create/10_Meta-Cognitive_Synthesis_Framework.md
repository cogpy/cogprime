# Meta-Cognitive Synthesis Framework

**Labels:** phase-3, meta-cognition, synthesis
**Phase:** Phase 3
**Priority:** Medium
**Estimated Effort:** 20-24 days

## Description

Develop a comprehensive meta-cognitive synthesis framework that integrates insights from cognitive science, philosophy of mind, and artificial intelligence to create a unified approach to meta-cognition within the CogPrime architecture.

This framework should enable higher-order thinking about thinking, self-awareness, and the ability to reason about cognitive processes themselves, creating a foundation for advanced artificial general intelligence capabilities.

## Tasks

- [ ] Design meta-cognitive architecture and interfaces
- [ ] Implement higher-order thinking about thinking capabilities
- [ ] Create self-awareness and introspection mechanisms
- [ ] Develop cognitive process reasoning and analysis
- [ ] Add meta-cognitive strategy selection and optimization
- [ ] Implement recursive meta-cognitive processing
- [ ] Create meta-cognitive knowledge representation systems
- [ ] Add meta-cognitive learning and adaptation mechanisms

## Acceptance Criteria

- Meta-cognitive architecture enables reasoning about cognitive processes
- Higher-order thinking demonstrates insight and understanding beyond first-order cognition
- Self-awareness mechanisms provide accurate introspective capabilities
- Cognitive process analysis improves system understanding and optimization
- Strategy selection adapts meta-cognitive approaches to different tasks
- Recursive processing enables deep meta-cognitive analysis
- Knowledge representation captures meta-cognitive insights effectively
- Learning mechanisms improve meta-cognitive capabilities over time

## Dependencies

- Relevance realization
- All Phase 3 components
