# Relevance Optimization System

**Labels:** phase-2, relevance, optimization
**Phase:** Phase 2
**Priority:** Medium
**Estimated Effort:** 10-14 days

## Description

Implement advanced relevance optimization mechanisms that dynamically prioritize cognitive resources based on contextual importance, goal relevance, and environmental demands. This system should incorporate Vervaeke's relevance realization framework principles.

The relevance optimization should improve efficiency, reduce cognitive load, and enhance the system's ability to focus on what matters most in any given context while maintaining flexibility and adaptability.

## Tasks

- [ ] Design relevance assessment and scoring algorithms
- [ ] Implement dynamic attention allocation based on relevance
- [ ] Create contextual importance weighting mechanisms
- [ ] Develop goal-relevance alignment systems
- [ ] Add environmental salience detection and processing
- [ ] Implement relevance-based memory retrieval optimization
- [ ] Create adaptive filtering based on relevance thresholds
- [ ] Add relevance feedback and learning mechanisms

## Acceptance Criteria

- Relevance scoring accurately predicts task importance and outcomes
- Dynamic attention allocation improves task performance by 35%
- Contextual weighting adapts appropriately to changing environments
- Goal-relevance alignment maintains focus on important objectives
- Salience detection identifies critical environmental changes
- Memory retrieval prioritizes relevant information effectively
- Adaptive filtering reduces cognitive load without losing important information

## Dependencies

- Cross-domain integration
- Attention mechanisms
