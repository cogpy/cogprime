## Creating GitHub Issues

### Method 1: Using the Batch Creation Script

Use the provided script to create all issues at once:

```bash
cd /home/runner/work/cogprime/cogprime
bash issues_to_create/create_all_issues.sh
```

This requires:
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated
- Write access to the repository

### Method 2: Using GitHub CLI Individually

Create issues one by one using GitHub CLI:

```bash
# Example: Create issue #1
gh issue create \
  --title "Enhanced Cognitive Capabilities Implementation" \
  --body-file issues_to_create/01_Enhanced_Cognitive_Capabilities_Implementation.md \
  --label "phase-2,enhancement,cognitive-architecture"

# Repeat for each issue...
```

### Method 3: Using the Python Script

Use the existing automated script:

```bash
cd /home/runner/work/cogprime/cogprime
python .github/scripts/generate_issues.py \
  --phase all \
  --dry-run False \
  --token "$GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  --repo "cogpy/cogprime"
```

### Method 4: Using GitHub Actions Workflow

1. Navigate to **Actions** tab in GitHub
2. Select "Generate Development Issues" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Select `all` for phase
5. Set dry-run to `false`
6. Execute

### Method 5: Manual Creation via GitHub Web UI

1. Go to the repository's Issues tab
2. Click "New Issue"
3. Copy content from each markdown file in this directory
4. Add appropriate labels
5. Create the issue
6. Repeat for all 15 issues

## Issue Structure

Each issue file contains:

- **Title**: Descriptive name of the development task
- **Labels**: Phase and category tags
- **Priority**: High/Medium classification
- **Estimated Effort**: Time estimate in days
- **Description**: Comprehensive explanation
- **Tasks**: Actionable checklist items
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Success metrics
- **Dependencies**: Prerequisites

## Verification Checklist

After creating issues, verify:

- [ ] All 15 issues created successfully
- [ ] Proper labels applied (phase-X, feature type)
- [ ] Task checklists formatted correctly
- [ ] Dependencies clearly listed
- [ ] Acceptance criteria measurable
- [ ] Issues linked to appropriate milestones (if applicable)

## Development Workflow

### Recommended Execution Order

1. **Phase 2 Issues** (1-5)
   - Start with issue #1 (Enhanced Cognitive Capabilities)
   - Dependencies flow: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5

2. **Phase 3 Issues** (6-10)
   - Requires Phase 2 completion
   - Start with issue #6 (Vervaeke Framework)
   - Dependencies flow: 6 → 7 → 8 → 9 → 10

3. **Phase 4 Issues** (11-15)
   - Requires Phase 3 completion
   - Focus on optimization and refinement
   - Dependencies flow: 11 → 12 → 13 → 14 → 15

### Parallel Work Opportunities

Some issues can be developed in parallel:
- Issues #4 and #5 (after #1-3 complete)
- Issues #7 and #8 (after #6 complete)
- Issues #12 and #13 (after #11 complete)

## Integration with Repository

These issues align with:

- **Module Structure**: `src/modules/` (perception, reasoning, action, learning)
- **Test Framework**: `src/tests/`
- **Documentation**: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/INTEGRATION_PATTERNS.md`
- **Existing Roadmap**: See main `README.md`

## Maintenance

- **Last Generated**: 2025-10-30
- **Generator Script**: `.github/scripts/generate_issues.py`
- **Issue Count**: 15 issues
- **Total Estimated Effort**: 195-280 days (sequential) / ~130-180 days (with parallelization)

## Additional Resources

- **Main Documentation**: See repository root `README.md`
- **Architecture Details**: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- **Issue Generation Guide**: `.github/scripts/README.md`
- **Original Issue Template**: `issuegenex.md`

## Notes

- These issues represent comprehensive development tasks
- Effort estimates assume a single developer working full-time
- Actual timeline may vary based on team size and expertise
- Issues should be reviewed and potentially broken into smaller tasks
- Dependencies should be managed through GitHub project boards or milestones
