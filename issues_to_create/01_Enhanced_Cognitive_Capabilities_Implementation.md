# Enhanced Cognitive Capabilities Implementation

**Labels:** phase-2, enhancement, cognitive-architecture
**Phase:** Phase 2
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Effort:** 8-12 days

## Description

Implement advanced cognitive processing capabilities that extend beyond the basic architecture established in Phase 1. This includes sophisticated reasoning patterns, enhanced memory systems, and improved decision-making algorithms that leverage the full potential of the CogPrime cognitive architecture.

The enhanced capabilities should integrate seamlessly with existing modules while providing significant improvements in cognitive flexibility, adaptation, and learning efficiency.

## Tasks

- [ ] Implement advanced pattern recognition algorithms in reasoning module
- [ ] Add sophisticated memory consolidation mechanisms
- [ ] Create adaptive attention allocation systems
- [ ] Develop enhanced goal hierarchies and planning capabilities
- [ ] Implement cross-modal integration for sensory processing
- [ ] Add cognitive flexibility metrics and monitoring
- [ ] Create dynamic resource allocation algorithms
- [ ] Implement advanced error correction and recovery mechanisms

## Acceptance Criteria

- Advanced reasoning capabilities demonstrate 30% improvement over baseline
- Memory consolidation reduces storage requirements by 20% while maintaining accuracy
- Attention allocation adapts dynamically to changing environmental demands
- Goal planning handles multi-level hierarchies with temporal constraints
- Cross-modal integration improves perception accuracy by 25%
- System maintains real-time performance with enhanced capabilities
- Comprehensive test coverage validates all new cognitive functions

## Dependencies

- Completed Phase 1 core implementation
- Performance baseline metrics
