# Relevance Realization Implementation

**Labels:** phase-3, relevance-realization, vervaeke-framework
**Phase:** Phase 3
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Effort:** 16-20 days

## Description

Implement Vervaeke's relevance realization framework as a core cognitive mechanism that guides attention, memory, and decision-making. This system should dynamically determine what is relevant in any given context and adaptively allocate cognitive resources accordingly.

The relevance realization system should operate across multiple time scales and cognitive levels, from immediate sensory processing to long-term goal planning and knowledge integration.

## Tasks

- [ ] Implement Vervaeke's relevance realization algorithms
- [ ] Create multi-scale relevance assessment mechanisms
- [ ] Develop adaptive relevance threshold systems
- [ ] Add relevance-guided attention and memory mechanisms
- [ ] Implement relevance-based knowledge integration
- [ ] Create relevance learning and adaptation systems
- [ ] Add relevance propagation across cognitive modules
- [ ] Implement relevance-action coupling mechanisms

## Acceptance Criteria

- Relevance realization accurately identifies contextually important information
- Multi-scale assessment operates effectively from milliseconds to hours
- Adaptive thresholds optimize relevance sensitivity for different contexts
- Attention and memory systems effectively utilize relevance guidance
- Knowledge integration prioritizes relevant information appropriately
- Learning systems improve relevance assessment accuracy over time
- Relevance propagation maintains consistency across cognitive modules
- Action coupling enables relevance-informed behavior selection

## Dependencies

- Meaning-making systems
- Attention mechanisms
