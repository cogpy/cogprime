## Integration with CogPrime

This Lua implementation can be integrated with the main CogPrime Python project:

1. **Lightweight embedding**: Lua can run in resource-constrained environments
2. **LuaJIT integration**: Can be called from Python via lupa or lua-python
3. **Alternative backend**: Can serve as lightweight AtomSpace backend
4. **Educational tool**: Easier to understand than full C++ implementation
5. **Prototyping**: Fast iteration for AGI experiments

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

1. **Persistence**: Add file-based storage
2. **Distributed**: Network-based distributed AtomSpace
3. **MeTTa**: Implement MeTTa language interpreter
4. **Neural integration**: Connect with neural networks
5. **More PLN rules**: Expand inference capabilities
6. **Graph algorithms**: Add centrality, clustering
7. **Visualization**: Generate graph visualizations
