## Integration with Existing CogPrime System

### Current Python System Enhancement

The RROS C++ kernel extends the existing Python-based relevance realization system:

**Before**: Python-only implementation with limited performance
```python
# Existing src/core/relevance_core.py
class RelevanceCore:
    def realize_relevance(self, query_atoms, context):
        # Python implementation - slower but flexible
        pass
```

**After**: Hybrid Python-C++ system with performance optimization
```cpp
// New rros_kernel/core/rros_kernel.cpp  
namespace rros {
class RROSKernel {
    // High-performance C++ implementation
    CognitiveState cognitive_cycle(input_data, context);
    RelevanceValue realize_relevance(data, episode_mask);
};
}
```

### Integration Points

1. **Performance-Critical Operations**: C++ kernel for real-time processing
2. **High-Level Coordination**: Python system for learning and adaptation
3. **Episode Specialization**: C++ processors for computational efficiency
4. **Memory Management**: Hybrid approach with C++ core and Python interfaces
